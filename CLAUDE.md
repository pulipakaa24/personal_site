# Personal Site — Master Context & Development Guide

> **This is the master context document for Aditya Pulipaka's personal portfolio site.**
> It is the single source of truth for *how this site is built, why it's built that way, what
> has been done, what the user has asked for, and what remains.* It exists so that any coding
> agent (or future me) can open it cold and **seamlessly continue developing in the same style**.
>
> ### ⚠️ KEEP THIS DOCUMENT ALIVE
> **This doc must be continuously updated. Update it as part of *every* operation** — not as an
> afterthought. When you change architecture, add a viewer, fix a gotcha, finish a task, or the
> user asks for something new:
> 1. Update the relevant section (architecture / conventions / viewer specifics).
> 2. Append to the **Changelog** (§12) what you did.
> 3. Append to **Requests Log** (§13) anything the user newly asked for, and move finished items.
> 4. Update **Roadmap / Remaining** (§14) and **Open Questions** (§15).
>
> Treat editing this file as the closing step of a task, the same way you'd update a test. If you
> only have time for one doc update, update the Changelog + Roadmap. A stale context doc is worse
> than none — it misleads the next agent.

## 1. Who the user is

**Aditya Pulipaka** — ECE Honors @ UT Austin (4.00 GPA), Embedded SWE Intern @ Qualcomm,
Levitation Subteam Lead @ Guadaloop (the UT Austin Hyperloop team). Email: `adipu@utexas.edu`.

He is a strong embedded/hardware + software engineer. He builds physical systems (sensors, motors,
levitation rigs, robotics) and the firmware/software around them. The portfolio's job is to show
**real engineering depth** through his hardware projects, led by bold typography and interactive
3D — *not* gimmicks.

**Working style he expects from agents:**
- He is technically precise and gives exact geometry / axis directions / values. Honor them literally;
  when in doubt about a physical detail, **ask rather than guess** (he has explicitly offered to
  hand-tune things himself if that's more precise).
- He verifies visually and expects you to verify too (headless render loop, §10) — don't claim a
  visual change works without rendering it.
- He likes self-contained, pragmatic solutions over heavy stacks.
- He'll say "pause when you finish this todo item" — respect explicit stop points.

## 2. What this site is (product vision)

A personal portfolio at `/Users/adipu/Personal Site/personal_site/` (its own git repo, branch `main`).

- **Self-contained static site. No build step.** Plain HTML/CSS/JS. Three.js loaded from the
  jsdelivr CDN via an ES-module import map (r160). This was a deliberate pragmatic-MVP choice over
  the Next.js + react-three-fiber stack an old `PORTFOLIO_ROADMAP.md` envisioned. Can migrate later;
  don't introduce a build step without the user asking.
- The hero experience is **scroll-driven 3D viewers** of his hardware projects (Guadaloop rig,
  RescueVision hub, and more to come), each telling the project's story as you scroll, then docking
  into a normal scrolling case-study.
- Visual identity: bold uppercase typography, black background, burnt-orange accent. Lead with type +
  photo + history. **No 3D model of his head** (he rejected it as uncanny-valley/gimmick) — 3D is
  reserved for the actual project hardware.

---

## 3. Design system (visual language)

Shared across landing page, project pages, and viewers. Mirror this for anything new.

- **Background:** black `#000`.
- **Display type:** white, "Helvetica Neue", huge **uppercase 800-weight** headings with negative
  letter-spacing. Outlined-word treatment (`.ol` — transparent fill, stroked) for hero titles.
- **Accent:** burnt **orange `#ff6a00`** (ties to UT Austin + the Guadaloop yoke color). This is the
  signature — use it for highlights, active states, leader lines.
- **Secondary accent:** cyan `#19d3ff` (used sparingly, e.g. UWB ripples).
- **Motion:** reveal-on-scroll via `IntersectionObserver`; pointer-following glow. Easing is
  `easeInOutCubic`-style; nothing snaps.
- **Coordinate-frame / dimension call-outs:** colored axes — **X red `#ff5a5a`, Y green `#57e07a`,
  Z blue `#5aa6ff`** (standard RGB=XYZ). SVG leader lines for dimensions.

**Three decoupled layers** (the user explicitly wants project pages to share ONE identity but handle
DIFFERENT content types equally — not every page is a 3D scroll experience):
1. **Identity layer** — `assets/project.css` + `assets/project.js`. Shared verbatim. Design tokens,
   nav, type, buttons, footer, reveal animations.
2. **Hero slot** — swappable media per page: scroll-driven 3D / embedded canvas, video, image/gallery,
   or abstract generated placeholder. Changing the medium must NOT change the chrome.
3. **Content modules** — opt-in blocks (overview, problem, deep-dive cards, results, gallery, video,
   diagram, facts strip). Each page composes only what its content needs.

**Source content** for the pages was pre-filled from the user's `LinkedIn_Compiled/` folder (in the
*old* root `/Users/adipu/Personal Site/`, NOT inside `personal_site/`): `projects/<slug>/<slug>.md`
(TL;DR, problem, stack, decisions), `courses.md`, `experience.md`, `education.md`,
`honors_and_credentials.md`, `skills_and_languages.md`.

## 5. The shared 3D viewer framework (`viewers/shared/`)

This is the heart of the interactive work. To build a new viewer, **copy `viewers/rescuevision/index.html`
as the template** and swap the GLB + `classify()` + `chapters`. A docking viewer also creates a
**`DockController`** (below) in `start()` and calls `dock.update()` from its `tick()` loop — that's the
whole dock-to-case-study shell; you no longer hand-roll `applyDock`/scroll-mapping/reveal-observer per viewer.

### `engine.js` (ES module) exports:
- **`DEV`** — the shared **dev-mode** flag, computed once at module load. Gates the developer-only chrome
  that every viewer carries: the top-left **`#hud-progress` "x%"** readout and the **press-G** editor
  (grouping or appearance). Casual visitors see neither. **Enable per-browser with `#dev` (or `?dev`)** in
  the viewer URL → it **persists via `localStorage['viewerDev']`** so you only type it once; **disable with
  `#nodev` (or `?dev=0`)**. When on, `engine.js` adds a **`.dev` class to `<body>`** (on DOMContentLoaded);
  `viewer.css` reveals `#hud-progress`/`#hint` only off `body.dev` (both are `display:none` by default).
  The G-key listeners are registered only when `DEV` (in `appearance.js` for RescueVision/SmartPT; inline
  `if (DEV) addEventListener(...)` in guadaloop/blindmaster). One flag → all four viewers.
- **Math:** `clamp01, lerp, smoothstep, ease (easeInOutCubic), trap, trapUpDown`.
- **`pca(pts)`** — PCA via Jacobi eigen-decomposition (shared by the coordinate-frame / hinge / tube-axis
  derivations); returns `{center, axes (sorted by extent desc), ext}`. *(Was duplicated inline in both
  viewers as `eigenSym3`+local PCA — centralized 2026-06-10.)*
- **`VIEWS`** — named camera directions (unit `dir` + `up`):
  - `iso` `(0.85,0.5,1.0)` — the default 3/4 view.
  - `iso2` `(0.34,-0.18,0.90)` — swung around and **slightly below, looking up** (RescueVision's
    second coordinate-frame perspective).
  - `isoL` (mirror iso), `front`, `back`, `side`, `top`.
- **`createStudioScene(canvas,{exposure,fov,near,far})`** — renderer + `ACESFilmicToneMapping` +
  studio IBL (`buildStudioEnv`) + hemisphere light + camera-relative headlights (`updateHeadlights`).
  Canvas is `alpha:true` so the page stays black behind the model; the env only lights/reflects.
- **`loadGLB`, `prepareMeshes(model,onMaterial)`** — clones per-mesh materials, stashes base colors,
  and sets a **stable per-load key** `o.userData.key = '<name>#<index>'` so unnamed CAD sub-meshes
  are independently targetable.
- **`centerModel, setOpacity` (depthWrite-on, avoids X-ray), `makeVis(VG)`, `frameCamera`, `projectPoint`.**
- **`Storyboard`** — the data-driven scroll engine. You give it `chapters[]`; it resolves the current
  scroll progress to a camera framing + opacities + overlays each frame.
- **`DockController`** — the shared dock shell. **⚠️ The flow is INVERTED as of 2026-06-11: case study FIRST,
  3D walkthrough AFTER (see §12).** `dockK=1` is now the TOP of the page (the model is docked in its corner card
  over the case study); it ramps to 0 across a short un-dock zone (`_undockSpan = min(0.9·innerHeight, 0.5·storySpan)`)
  at the start of the `#spacer`, where the floater grows back to full screen, and `progress` maps the storyboard
  after that. `layout()` derives `_storyStart = spacer.offsetTop` / `_storySpan` / `_undockSpan`; `_onScroll()` does
  `dockK = clamp01(1 − (scrollY − _storyStart)/_undockSpan)` and `progress = clamp01((x − _undockSpan)/(_storySpan −
  _undockSpan))`. (Originally a storyboard-first "dock-to-case-study" shell; extracted 2026-06-10, was duplicated in
  both viewers.) Owns: the scroll→`progress`/`dockK` mapping + `layout()`; the canvas dock lerp
  (`applyDock`); the storyboard-overlay fade; the `#case .reveal` IntersectionObserver; and the **docked
  rotisserie with the smooth two-way hand-off** (the `ang0 + wrapPi(spin)*spinKeep` orbit — see §7).
  Construct in `start()` with `{ canvas, renderer, camera, spacer, getBox:()=>boxes.all,
  onStory:(p)=>story.resolve(p), onDockSettle? }` (`onDockSettle` runs every docked frame — SmartPT uses it
  to reset the brace to the assembled pose). The viewer keeps its own `tick()` (editor/tuner/render) and
  just calls `dock.update()` while the storyboard is active; read `dock.dockK`/`dock.shownProgress` for any
  viewer-side logic (drag guards, editor re-resolve). Relies on the standard ids (`#c`, `#spacer`,
  `#title/#panel/#blurb/#dims`, `#scrollhint/#hint/#hud-progress`, optional `#dockhint`). The docked-card
  CSS (`#c.docked`, `#dockhint`) lives in `viewer.css`. **Every viewer now docks — Guadaloop too** (it docks
  into the **LevSim** case study; see §8). The constructor **initialises `dockK`/`progress` from the current
  scroll** (`this._onScroll(); this.shownProgress = this.progress;`) so a **reload while scrolled into the case
  study docks immediately** instead of rendering the full-screen storyboard "active" behind `#case` until the
  first scroll input (a long-standing latent bug — any scroll input *was* necessary & sufficient to settle it).
  It also owns the **docked-window controls** (built in JS by `_buildDockUI()`, no per-viewer HTML, shown only
  when `dockK ≥ 0.985`): `#dockwin` (transparent click-catcher over the card → `enterVisualizer()` smooth-scrolls
  **DOWN** to the visualizer storyboard start `_storyStart+_undockSpan`; the smooth-scroll passes through the un-dock
  zone so the floater grows + the title fades in on the way), `#dockmin` ("›" minimise → `collapse()` slides the card
  off the right edge via `#c.docked.collapsed`), and `#docktab` ("‹ 3D" edge tab → `expand()`). `update()` auto-clears
  `collapsed` when `dockK < DOCK_FULL`. Minimise (corner button) and enter-visualizer (body click) are intentionally
  separate gestures. `_cardRect()` is the single source for the card's resting rect (shared by `applyDock` + the
  controls). `_buildDockUI()` also builds **`#skipcase` ("↑ Back to case study")** — a user-facing (NOT dev-gated)
  glass chip shown during the walkthrough (`applyDock` hides it once `dockK > 0.03`, same trigger as
  `#scrollhint`/`#hint`); **`backToCase()`** smooth-scrolls to the top of the page (the case study is now first). It
  also sets the **`#dockhint`** copy to **"Explore in 3D ↓"** — the soft-pulsing glass chip (`viewer.css`
  `@keyframes explorePulse` glow + `hintbob` arrow bob, centred under the card by `applyDock`, shown when `dockK>0.7`)
  that invites the click since the walkthrough isn't shown up front. One set of controls on the shared controller →
  all four viewers get them for free.

### The `Storyboard` chapter model
Each chapter is an object:
```js
{ r:[start,end],            // scroll-progress range it owns (0..1 over the #spacer)
  box:'<groupKey>'|'all',   // what to frame (a vis-group, or a named runtime Box3 like 'transform')
  view:'iso'|'front'|...,   // camera direction from VIEWS
  pan: 0..1,                // horizontal offset (model slides left so panels have room);
                            //   auto-reduced on narrow/portrait viewports — frameCamera scales it by
                            //   min(1, camera.aspect/PAN_FULL_ASPECT) so it never slides off a phone's left edge
  fit: number,              // zoom multiplier on the framed box (bigger = further out); on narrow/portrait
                            //   viewports frameCamera adds an extra zoom-out (PORTRAIT_FIT, `#pfit=`) so a
                            //   wide model fits the horizontal FOV too — landscape/desktop are unchanged
  vis: vis({ALL:1, grp:1}), // per-vis-group target opacity (TRANS≈translucent for the rest)
  panel:{mode:'hero'|'side'|'none', sec, blurb, tag},
  dims:'<kind>'|null,       // which dimension/coord overlay to draw
  finale:bool,
  hooks:{ onResolve(ctx), drawDims(kind) }  // per-chapter project-specific per-frame work
}
```
Key behaviors:
- Camera lerps from the previous chapter's framing to the current one, reaching target by
  `localT == HOLD (0.62)` then holding. Easing `easeInOutCubic`.
- Per-vis-group opacity uses neighbor-aware fade windows (return-to-assembly chapters fade the rest
  back in LATE, only after the camera pulls away).
- Overlays: hero title scrolls up; side panel (top-right) + bottom blurb fade per `panel`; `dims`
  SVG overlay. **The dims overlay holds across consecutive same-`dims` chapters** (no flicker between
  multi-stage acts) — `updateOverlays` is neighbor-aware.

### `appearance.js` — `AppearanceEditor` (press **G** in any viewer)
The GLBs ship with few/no good materials, so this lets the user dress them and export JSON.
- **Palette** of material presets (PCB green, black plastic, matte black, white ABS, grey nylon,
  aluminium, steel, copper, gold pin, accent orange, signal red, signal blue) — `DEFAULT_PALETTE`.
- **Three click modes:**
  - **Part** — the whole clicked sub-mesh.
  - **Body** — the whole connected sub-body (vertex-adjacency flood across all shared edges, **no angle
    limit**) — isolates one solid even inside a multi-body primitive. *This is the mode for "ESP32 is
    black but the RF shield is aluminium" / "sensor is red but the antenna square is black".*
  - **Face** — coplanar facet only.
- Everything keyed by the stable `userData.key = '<name>#<index>'` (legacy bare-name keys still resolve,
  distinguished by the `#`). A single part can carry **multiple** facet/body appearances:
  `paintFacesMulti` batches ALL of a mesh's assignments into ONE geometry-group rebuild. *(Bug history:
  an earlier per-call `clearGroups()` let only the last assignment survive — fixed.)*
- Sliders for color/metalness/roughness, "+ new appearance", **Export → `appearance.json`**.
- `applyAppearance(meshes, json)` re-applies a saved map at load. JSON shape:
  `{palette, parts:{key:idx}, faces:[{name/key, app, tris}]}`.
- **`tris` is run-length encoded** as inclusive `[[start,end], …]` ranges (the older flat `[i,…]` list
  still loads — `expandTris` normalizes either). **Export compacts losslessly** via `compactAppearance(json, triCountOf)`
  (2026-06-10): per mesh it (1) flattens overlapping/stale face layers (LATER wins per triangle, matching
  `paintFacesMulti`) so re-painting a body doesn't pile up dead copies; (2) drops face triangles whose final
  app **equals the mesh's base `part`** (they render identically, so they fall through to the base);
  (3) promotes a single app that covers a whole mesh to a `parts` entry (needs `triCountOf`, skipped if null —
  still correct); (4) merges survivors by app and RLE-encodes. **Why it matters:** the editor only ever *appends*
  face entries and used to pretty-print the flat lists, so RescueVision's file had ballooned to **854 KB / 58 551
  lines** (the same body painted 5× over multiple sessions, ~58 k explicit indices). Migrated in place to **1.4 KB /
  1 line** (8 760 real tris → 18 ranges) with a pixel-identical render — same workflow, smart serialization.

### `viewer.css`
All shared viewer chrome: hero `#title` with outlined `.ol` word, `#panel` (top-right side title),
`#blurb` (bottom-right), `#dims` SVG overlay (+ `.ax-x/.ax-y/.ax-z/.pill` coord call-out classes),
`nav` (with **glass chips** on `.brand`/`.pbtn`), `#loader`, the **docked-window controls**
(`#dockwin`/`#dockmin`/`#docktab` + `#c.docked.collapsed` slide-off), the **`#skipcase`** "skip to case study"
glass chip (bottom-center, above `#scrollhint`; `body.editing #skipcase{display:none}`), and the editor shell
(`#editor/#legend/#picked/#dump`). The **`#hud-progress`/`#hint` are dev-only** (`display:none` by default,
revealed off `body.dev`). Phone breakpoint `@media(max-width:640px)` + `@media(pointer:coarse)`.

### GLTFLoader gotcha (bit us hard — remember it)
**Node names get spaces and dots STRIPPED** by GLTFLoader
(e.g. `NEMA 17 Stepper Motor 23mm.STEP` → `NEMA17StepperMotor23mmSTEP`). Always match against a
compacted lowercase ancestor-name chain:
```js
names.join('/').replace(/[^a-z0-9]/gi,'').toLowerCase()
```

## 6. Local verification workflow (headless render loop) — USE THIS

Never claim a visual change works without rendering it. Three.js viewers need HTTP, not `file://`.

1. **Serve the repo root:**
   `python3 -m http.server 8100 --directory "/Users/adipu/Personal Site/personal_site"` (background).
   URLs: `/index.html`, `/viewers/guadaloop/index.html`, `/viewers/rescuevision/index.html`.
2. **Screenshot via puppeteer-core driving installed Chrome** (in `/tmp`, since the 3D viewers need a
   real GL context):
   - puppeteer-core@23 installed in `/tmp`; require `/private/tmp/node_modules/puppeteer-core`.
   - Chrome: `/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome`.
   - WebGL launch args: `--use-gl=angle --use-angle=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader
     --ignore-gpu-blocklist --no-sandbox`.
   - **Defeat headless throttling:** add `--disable-background-timer-throttling
     --disable-renderer-backgrounding --disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows`, and after
     `window.scrollTo`, **poll `#hud-progress` until it equals the target %** before capturing —
     otherwise you screenshot a mid-transition frame and misread it as a bug.
   - For landing-page scroll-reveal, scroll `document.scrollingElement` (NOT `window`) before a
     `fullPage` capture so IntersectionObserver fires.
3. **Reusable scripts in `/private/tmp`** (recreate if `/tmp` was cleaned — it's periodically wiped):
   - `shotu.cjs <urlPath> <out> <frac>` — generic.
   - `shotp.cjs <out> <storyProgress>` — RescueVision; scrolls by storyboard progress via the `#spacer`.
   - `shotbody.cjs` — landing page.
   - `shotdock.cjs`, `shotori.cjs <hash>`, `shotcard.cjs <worldDir>`, `diagrender.cjs` (group-colored
     model overview), `pca.cjs` (per-group PCA), `frames.cjs` (reads actor frame vectors),
     `uwb.cjs` (UWB sub-mesh inspection), `errcheck.cjs` (console errors), `bodytest.cjs`, `edcheck.cjs`.

Node is v26. This loop was used to read live three.js material state and tune every storyboard beat.

### Mobile / iPhone verification (added 2026-06-10)
Three complementary loops — pick by what you're testing:
1. **iPhone-viewport (Chrome / puppeteer)** — `/private/tmp/iphone.cjs <urlPath> <outPrefix> <fracs>`. Reuses
   the puppeteer-core+Chrome harness with `page.emulate({viewport:{390×844, isMobile, hasTouch}})`. Fast and
   scriptable; drives the storyboard via `scrollTo`. **Use for** mobile **layout + perf + per-frame** render
   checks + console health. **Does NOT** reproduce Safari's scroll quirk (Chrome lacks it).
2. **Real iOS Simulator (authentic Mobile Safari / WebKit)** — `xcrun simctl list devices available | grep
   iPhone`; boot `xcrun simctl boot <udid>` + `open -a Simulator`; the sim shares the host network so load
   `xcrun simctl openurl booted http://localhost:8100/...`; capture `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot out.png`.
   **Gold standard for rendering/layout on true iOS.** **Caveat — can't script touch gestures:** synthetic
   host input needs macOS Accessibility (TCC) which can't be granted programmatically — `cliclick` is blocked,
   and `idb` needs the dead `facebook/fb` brew tap. So you only see **frame 1** unless the user grants
   Accessibility to the terminal (then `cliclick` click-drags on the sim window become real touches) or tests
   on a physical iPhone.
3. **Real WebKit hit-test (Playwright webkit)** — `/private/tmp/wk_hittest.cjs`. Runs the actual Safari engine
   headless; A/Bs `document.elementFromPoint(centerX,centerY)` with the canvas `pointer-events` forced
   `auto` (OLD) vs as-shipped (FIXED). This proves the **exact causal mechanism** of the scroll bug + the fix
   on the real engine without needing a touch gesture (a native touch-pan can't be script-driven in any
   engine — synthetic touch events don't trigger native scrolling). Playwright+webkit live in `/private/tmp`
   (`npm i playwright` + `npx playwright install webkit`).

## 7. RescueVision viewer (`viewers/rescuevision/`) — the reference build

The most fully-developed viewer; the template for all others. Model: `hub.glb`. Built on the §5 framework.

### Model quirks
`hub.glb` is an **assembled hub HEAD** (radar / ESP32 / UWB / mount / breadboards + stepper body)
clustered tightly, PLUS **loose unassembled CAD parts** (LM2596/MT3608/A4988 boards, stepper connector
pins & screws) dumped far away near the origin. The viewer detects the head cluster (around the grey
`HubMain` enclosure) and **hides every mesh whose center is > ~4.5× the enclosure size from the head
center** → 110 of 124 meshes kept, clean framing.

### Orientation — driven off the ESP32's own axes
The user wanted the **ESP32 ("the brain")** as the upright, camera-facing reference (NOT the radar).
Pipeline: stand up `rx = -90°` (SolidWorks Z-up → Y-up), then apply a rotation mapping the ESP32's
measured PCA long-axis `ESP_U=(0.035,0.979,0.198)` → world **+Y** (upright) and its face normal
`ESP_N=(0.017,0.198,-0.980)` → the iso camera azimuth (face directly faces camera). Built via
`Matrix4.makeBasis(targets).multiply(makeBasis(src).invert())`. Those constants were PCA-measured in
the standup frame — **re-measure if `hub.glb` changes.** Still hash-tunable on top via `#rx=&ry=&rz=`
(degrees, world axes).

### Vis-groups (`classify()`, compacted-name regex)
`iwr` (TI board placeholder / mmWave sensor), `stepper` (NEMA 17), `esp32` (ESP32-S3-DEVKITC),
`uwb` (Qorvo DWM3001CDK), `power`, `hubbody` (HubMain), `mount` (RadioMount / RadarMountToStepper),
`other`.

### Storyboard (scroll mapped over a ~1150vh `#spacer`)
Current chapters (see `index.html` ~line 426):
| range | box | view | fit | beat |
|-------|-----|------|-----|------|
| 0.00–0.06 | all | iso | — | intro / hero title |
| 0.06–0.16 | iwr | iso | — | **01** isolate IWR mmWave sensor (rest translucent) |
| 0.16–0.24 | iwr | front | — | IWR front-on |
| 0.24–0.36 | stepper | iso | — | **02** isolate stepper motor |
| 0.36–0.48 | esp32 | iso | — | **02** isolate ESP32 (same "Sweep & Brain"/Control section) |
| 0.48–0.56 | frame | iso | 2.3 | **03** Frame of Reference, stage 1 — establish both coord frames in context |
| 0.56–0.64 | transform | iso2 | 1.25 | **03** stage 2 — camera swings **down/looks up + zooms in tight** on the transform |
| 0.64–0.90 | scene | iso | 1.45 | **04** Responder Localization finale |
| 0.90–1.00 | all | iso | 2.0 | settle |

### Coordinate frames (the precise part — the user gave exact axis directions)
Axes are derived **at runtime from each module's actual geometry** (PCA via `analyzeGroup` / `eigenSym3`
Jacobi), to match the real frames in the firmware header
`LinkedIn_Compiled/projects/rescue-vision/rescueVision/include/dwm_geom.h`.
- **TI mmWave (IWR) convention:** x = right / along long body, y = forward / **boresight (out the
  antenna bump)**, z = up. In the inverted hub: **IWR(CS1)** X = long body, Y = boresight out the bump
  (CS1 is **centered on the bump cluster**), Z = width (down).
- **UWB (DWM3001, CS2):** X = flat-side normal, Y = thin side, Z = down (hub is inverted vs the
  SolidWorks image). **CS2 is centered on the DWM antenna** — auto-detected as the small UWB sub-body
  that pops furthest out of the flat face toward the bottom
  (`score = maxProjection·X2 + 0.4·centroid·Z2`; picks `mesh_67_2`, a 156-tri body at the board bottom).
- The two modules are **genuinely rotated relative to each other** (different Z directions) — this is
  real, per the user and the image. Don't "fix" them to be parallel.
- Gizmos are small thin arrows rendered **on top** (`depthTest:false; depthWrite:false; renderOrder:10`,
  length `L=S*0.10`), so they aren't occluded inside translucent boards. Offset "legs" (the stepped
  path from CS1 to CS2) are lines `depthTest:false renderOrder:9`.
- **Real transform offsets (IWR frame, from `dwm_geom.h`):** dX **−43.18**, dY **+13.97**, dZ **+92.43**
  mm, distance ≈ **103.0 mm**. (NOT the image's 54.82/83.47 — that was a misread; `dwm_geom.h` is
  authoritative. Also `DWM_GEOM_TILT_X_DEG = −10.0`.)
- Grid + gizmos + offset legs are driven off **GLOBAL** scroll progress (`FRAME_R`) so they persist
  across the stage-1→stage-2 boundary instead of popping.

> **⚠️ OPEN — axis "out" signs (see §15):** the two boresight/normal out-signs and the two down-signs
> are best-guess defaults, flippable live via URL hash: `#cs1y=1` (radar boresight), `#cs1z=1` (radar
> down), `#cs2x=1` (UWB flat normal), `#cs2z=1` (UWB down). **Awaiting the user's confirmed combo to
> bake as default and drop the hash.**

### Finale (04 — Responder Localization)
Camera pulls back to a scene box; a phone glides in on a ground grid; cyan UWB ripples (billboard
rings) emanate from the Qorvo module; a phone→UWB ranging line resolves **dashed → solid** as it
"locks" (indicator dot **orange → green**). The phone is **draggable on the XZ plane** during the finale.

### Dock-to-case-study
> **⚠️ Flow inverted 2026-06-11 (§12):** the case study is now FIRST with the model docked over it; the
> storyboard plays AFTER (the floater enlarges when you scroll to the bottom of the case study). The mechanics
> below (the dock lerp, the opaque card, the two-way rotation hand-off) are all unchanged — only the scroll
> direction that drives `dockK` was inverted in the shared `DockController`. Read "after the storyboard" below as
> "before the storyboard / while reading the case study."

After the storyboard, scroll keeps going: the fixed canvas **lerps to a top-right card** (`#c.docked`,
responsive size), storyboard overlays fade out, the docked model auto-rotates, and a normal-flow
`<article id="case">` (the RescueVision write-up) scrolls in below. `dockK` from
`(scrollY − (storyEnd − 0.45vh)) / 0.7vh`. The docked card is **collapsible** (minimise "›" → slides off to a
"‹ 3D" edge tab) and **clicking the model replays the walkthrough** (smooth-scrolls back up) — both shared via
`DockController` (§5), so SmartPT gets them too.
- **Opaque floating window:** `#c.docked` is an **opaque** dark card (`background:#0a0b0e`) with
  `z-index:6` — *above* the article (`#case` is `z-index:5`, and its `.facts div`/`.dive` cards are
  opaque). So page content scrolls cleanly **behind** the card instead of clashing over the model. (The
  canvas keeps `pointer-events:none` once docked so scroll/clicks still reach the article underneath.)
- **Rotation hand-off (smooth, two-way):** the auto-rotate is an azimuth orbit around `boxes.all`,
  `ang = ang0 + wrapPi(dockSpin)*spinKeep`. `ang0` = the **settled iso azimuth** (so docking in continues
  from where the scroll left off — no jolt). `dockSpin` (eased up from rest, `DOCK_SPIN_SPEED 0.2` rad/s)
  accumulates **only when fully docked** (`dockK ≥ DOCK_FULL 0.999`). `spinKeep =
  smoothstep((dockK − DOCK_SETTLE 0.8)/(DOCK_FULL − DOCK_SETTLE))` blends the spin **out** across the
  transition band `dockK ∈ [0.8, 1]`, so scrolling back *up* eases the model back to the iso framing as a
  function of scroll position — via the **shortest angular path** (`wrapPi`, so long accumulated spins
  don't whirl backwards). Below `DOCK_SETTLE` the orbit hands off to `story.resolve` and `dockSpin` resets.
  *(SmartPT uses the identical dock loop; its orbit branch also resets the shell to the assembled pose +
  hides the leg silhouette.)*

**The case-study article uses the SHARED `assets/project.css` identity** (linked into the viewer after
`viewer.css`), with the exact same markup as `projects/*.html`: `.wrap` → `.award` pill + `.lede` →
`dl.facts.reveal` → `section.block.reveal` (orange-dash `h2`s) → `.dives/.dive` cards → `.btn` media
links → `footer.wrap`. So the scrolled-in write-up reads identically to TweinStein et al. A small inline
`<style>` only carries the bits unique to the docked-viewer context (`#case` z-index/padding, a `.lede`
`max-width` + extra `padding-top` to clear the top-right model card, `.dive` bullet markers). A reveal
`IntersectionObserver` in the viewer script adds `.in` to `#case .reveal` (project.css hides `.reveal`
at opacity 0, so this is REQUIRED or the write-up renders blank). *(Earlier the case study had a
hand-rolled inline approximation of the project-page look — replaced 2026-06-09 to use the real shared
CSS.)*

### Appearance
`appearance.json` ships the palette + the painted assignments (the sensor placeholder is **red** (app 10);
`mesh_2_3#5` is **aluminium** (app 5) over a matte-black base part). Model otherwise uses baked CAD colors
with a matte default (roughness ≥ 0.52). Dress further via the **G** editor. The file is the **compact
run-length form** (see §5 `compactAppearance`) — it was a 854 KB / 58 551-line monster of stale duplicate
per-triangle index lists, migrated 2026-06-10 to 1.4 KB with a verified-identical render.

## 8. Guadaloop viewer (`viewers/guadaloop/`)

The scroll-driven 3D viewer of the Guadaloop levitation rig. Model `model_plain.glb` + `groups.json`.
Originally the standalone prototype (`site_prototype/`, now deleted), **ported onto the shared engine**.
It keeps its own inline **grouping** editor (assigns vis-groups, NOT appearances — different from the
RescueVision appearance editor).

Full multi-stage storyboard (spec in `viewers/guadaloop/instruct.md`): outlined-word hero title
(upper-left) → per-section stages where the model pans left while a side title + bottom blurb appear and
the camera swings iso/front/top. Vis-groups (`yokecore, coil, sensormod, sensorholder, railbar,
railslider, railholder, railtrack, chassis, other`) tagged by `semanticByName()` + geometry backfill
(unnamed instances inherit a named sibling's tag) so sub-parts fade independently. Rails finale = the
**sled** (chassis + yoke + sensors + coils + lower slider) travels world +Y on a `trap()` trapezoidal
profile while bars/track/clamps stay fixed (movers precompute worldBase + parentInv for exact world-space
translation). The last finale chapter is split into `[0.91,0.97]` movement + a `[0.97,1.00]` **settle**
(box `all`, iso, `fit:2.0`, panel `none`, no motion) so the docked-card framing (also `fit:2.0`) hands off
cleanly.

### Dock-to-LevSim case study (added 2026-06-11)
Originally a no-dock viewer; it now docks like the others (RescueVision §7) into the **LevSim** case study —
the sim environment built to control this rig (source `Guadaloop/Lev-Sim.md` + `System.md` dataflow). Uses
the shared **`DockController`** (created in `start()` with `getBox:()=>boxes.all, onStory:(p)=>story.resolve(p)`);
the manual `scroll`→`progress` handler + `tick()` smoothing were removed (DockController owns them). Added:
`#spacer { height:1500vh }` (was `body`), `#dockhint`, the `assets/project.css` link, and an `<article id="case">`
using the shared identity (`.award`/`.lede`/`.facts`/`.block`/`.dives`/`footer`). The system-overview asset is a
**redrawn SVG architecture diagram** (BlindMaster-style classes) of the LevSim dataflow: offline strip *Ansys FEA
→ force/torque LUT → polynomial `Maglev_Model.pkl`*, then a runtime hub-and-spoke around **`Lev_pod_env.py`**
(Gymnasium env, 240 Hz) wired to MagLev Predictor, PyBullet, Controllers (PID/LQR/RL), and `maglev_coil.py`.
The grouping editor still works: `exitEdit` now resolves at `dock.shownProgress`, and `enterEdit` **restores a
full-screen canvas** (clears the inline dock sizing + `renderer.setSize`) so pressing **G** while docked opens
the editor full-screen. `viewer.css` hides `#case`/`#dockhint`/`#dockwin`/`#docktab` under `body.editing` so the
case study can't paint over the editor canvas (z5 > z1).

### Lighting recipe (CAD-render look) — hard-won, reuse for metal-heavy models
Target look: the reference render `Guadaloop/TestRig Current/UsefulCrop.png` (glossy studio CAD —
bright satin steel, clean white plastic, saturated copper). The rig is almost entirely metal
(metalness=1), which has **no diffuse — it's lit only by what it reflects**:
- **Direct lights barely matter for metals** — the look comes from the **IBL environment**, not
  DirectionalLights. Stock `RoomEnvironment` is a dark room → smooth metals mirror black. Replaced with
  a custom bright **gradient studio env** (`buildStudioEnv()`): bright-cool-top → dark-base surround
  sphere + HDR emissive softbox panels (tall ones for vertical glints), low PMREM blur (~0.06) so
  reflections stay crisp.
- **Mirror vs satin was THE fix:** CAD steel at `roughness 0.14` reflects the dark side of the room →
  reads black. Bump every metal to `roughness ≥ 0.34` (satin) → reflects the bright average → bright
  brushed steel.
- **Tone mapping: `ACESFilmicToneMapping`** (exposure ~1.1). AgX desaturates/flattens — wrong here.
- Warm camera key + cool fill (camera-relative) + cool hemisphere → warm-highlight / blue-shadow studio.
- The vertical `Slide_rail_metal_bar` parts ship as bluish `defaultplastic`; recolored to the track's
  `polishedsteel` (`baseColor [0.573,0.542,0.511]`) at load so they match.

## 9. Landing page (`index.html`)

Self-contained, ~817 lines. Sections: hero, marquee, about, **work grid**, experience timeline, honors,
coursework, skills, contact/footer.
- **Work grid (DESKTOP ≠ MOBILE since 2026-06-12):** 7 projects. The 4 with CAD `.glb` files are
  `.card.feat` and link to their 3D viewers: **Guadaloop** (→ `viewers/guadaloop/`), **RescueVision**
  (→ `viewers/rescuevision/`), **SmartPT**, **BlindMaster**; LiDAR-SLAM, TweinStein, Harmonium link to
  `projects/*.html`. Thumbnails live in `assets/projects/<name>/`.
  - **Mobile (≤860px): UNCHANGED** — `.card.feat` are big row/stacked **banners** with the thumbnail
    always visible + corner "3D" cube badge; the 3 case-study projects are plain text cards.
  - **Desktop (≥861px): hover-reveal gallery** (added in a `@media (min-width:861px)` block so mobile is
    untouched). ALL 7 cards collapse to the **same compact text-card size** (`.card.feat` overridden to
    look like a normal `.card`). At rest = title/badge/sub/tags/go only, no image. **On hover the text
    fully fades out and the thumbnail fills the card** (`.ph` becomes an `opacity:0→1`, `position:absolute`
    overlay at `z-index:3`, scoped as `.work-grid .card .ph` to outrank the base `.card.feat .ph` rules).
    Viewer cards keep their in-`.ph` "3D" cube badge so it shows on the revealed thumbnail; case-study
    cards show just the photo.
  - **`.ph.fit` modifier (Guadaloop + BlindMaster):** their thumbnails are 3D **model renders on black
    backgrounds** (`guadaloop/testrig.png`, `blindmaster/Thumbnail.png` — the blue/red hub render that
    replaced the old `icon.png`). `.fit` = `object-fit:contain` + `background:#000` (base-level rule, so
    BOTH mobile banner AND desktop hover show the whole model on black, blending with the render's own
    black backdrop). The other photo thumbnails (RescueVision/SmartPT/LiDAR/TweinStein/Harmonium) stay
    `object-fit:cover`. `.ph.fit` selectors carry extra specificity to beat both the base `.card.feat .ph
    img.cover` and the desktop `.work-grid .card .ph img.cover` cover rules. The 3 text cards got a hidden `<div class="ph deskthumb">` (base
    `display:none`, shown only on desktop) so they have a thumbnail to reveal: LiDAR → its hero,
    Harmonium → `hero.jpeg`, **TweinStein → `tw_robot.jpeg`** (the car-between-barriers close-up from its
    gallery, NOT `tw_hero.jpeg`). 7 cards in 2 cols intentionally leave an **uneven last row** (Harmonium
    alone) — kept for scalability.
  - **Headless gotcha:** clipped puppeteer screenshots (`page.screenshot({clip})`) of this grid render a
    STALE/wrong layer for the hover-overlay `.ph` (shows images at rest even when computed `opacity` is
    `0`). Verify with **full-viewport** screenshots + `page.hover()` instead (`/private/tmp/shot_hover.cjs`).
- **Skill chips are clickable** — each opens a popover listing the projects + courses that used it,
  built by inverting a `PROJECTS`/`COURSES` skill map in the page script.
- **Credentials convention (apply consistently):** de-emphasize but don't hide high-school-era signals.
  Recognition drops National Merit + HS Summa Cum Laude; SAT/PSAT live in a *lighter* "Standardized
  Tests" strip (not award cards). Coursework lists relevant **college** courses (no "transfer" labels);
  AP/gen-ed transfers are acknowledged in ONE muted footnote, not itemized. Course numbers come from the
  official transcript (Neural Engineering is **ECE 385J**, not ECE 374N as LinkedIn said). 4.00 GPA.

## 10. Conventions & gotchas (quick reference)

- **No build step. No new dependencies / frameworks without the user asking.** Three.js via CDN import map.
- **GLTFLoader strips spaces & dots from names** — match compacted lowercase name chains (§5).
- **Per-mesh material clone** in `prepareMeshes`; opacity via `setOpacity` with depthWrite ON (no X-ray).
- **Stable keys:** `userData.key = '<name>#<index>'` — use for any per-sub-mesh targeting.
- **Coordinate-axis colors:** X red, Y green, Z blue. Gizmos render on top (`depthTest:false`).
- **Physical accuracy comes from source, not the marketing image:** firmware headers (`dwm_geom.h`) and
  measured PCA beat a possibly-inverted SolidWorks screenshot. When the user cites exact axis directions
  or values, those win — honor them literally.
- **iOS scroll-eating fixed canvas:** a viewport-filling `position:fixed` element with `pointer-events:auto`
  swallows the touch-scroll gesture on **iOS WebKit** (the page won't scroll behind it; desktop wheel-scroll
  is unaffected, so the bug hides until you test on a phone). Keep `#c` `pointer-events:none` on touch
  devices — the exported `COARSE` const (`matchMedia('(pointer:coarse)')`) in `engine.js` gates this *and*
  the mobile render budget (no MSAA, DPR≤1.5). Re-enable canvas pointer-events only where needed
  (`body.editing #c`, or `applyDock`'s `!COARSE` branch for the desktop phone-drag).
- **Verify visually** before declaring a visual change done (§6). Poll `#hud-progress` before shooting.
- **Clean up debug handles** before finishing (`window.__rv`, `__editor`, `__debug`) — grep to confirm.
- **Hash overrides** are the live-tuning mechanism for things awaiting the user's eye (`#rx/#ry/#rz`,
  `#cs1y/#cs1z/#cs2x/#cs2z`). Bake confirmed values as defaults and drop the hash once approved.
- **Dev mode (`DEV`, engine.js):** the **"x%" HUD + press-G editor are dev-only** and hidden in production.
  Turn them on per-browser with **`#dev`** (persists via `localStorage`), off with **`#nodev`**. Gated by a
  single shared flag + a `body.dev` CSS class — don't re-introduce always-on HUD/hint or ungated G handlers
  in a viewer. (Note: a **hash-only** navigation doesn't reload the page, so the module won't re-read `#dev`
  — load the URL fresh / reload; this also bit the headless test until it forced a full load.)
- **HDR / wide-gamut photos wash out in browsers.** iPhone photos are often **HDR JPEGs** (profile
  `Display P3 Primaries; PQ (Adaptive Gain Curve …)`). macOS Preview/Photos render the gain map (vibrant);
  browsers show the PQ/SDR base → **flat / washed-out**. Before adding a photo, check it:
  `sips -g profile <img>`. If it's **PQ/HDR**, bake to sRGB SDR:
  `sips --matchTo '/System/Library/ColorSync/Profiles/sRGB Profile.icc' in.jpeg --out out.jpeg` (ColorSync
  tone-maps PQ→sRGB). Plain **`Display P3`** (wide-gamut **SDR**) is fine — browsers color-manage it; leave it.
  Verify the result renders with proper contrast (the Read tool / a browser shot shows the SDR look). See §12
  (2026-06-12). *(Hero captions use `.hero-media .cap` — a glass chip in `project.css`, legible over any image.)*
- Respect explicit **pause points** ("pause when you finish this item").
- **Deploy = Cloudflare Pages** (`aditya.pulipaka.com`, repo `pulipakaa24/personal_site`; a push auto-deploys).
  Cloudflare's default **Browser Cache TTL pins `.css`/`.js` for 4h with no revalidation** → edits don't show
  up on reload (the user hit this in Safari). A repo-root **`_headers`** file forces `*.css`/`*.js`/`*.html`
  to `public, max-age=0, must-revalidate` (revalidate each load; ETag → 304 when unchanged). HTML + `.glb`
  already revalidate. Verify after deploy: `curl -sI https://aditya.pulipaka.com/assets/project.css` →
  `max-age=0`. If still `14400`, flip the dashboard Browser Cache TTL to **"Respect Existing Headers."** See
  §12 (2026-06-10) for the full diagnosis + the deferred `?v=<hash>` cache-bust alternative.

## 11. Source-of-truth files (outside the repo)

These live in the OLD root `/Users/adipu/Personal Site/` (NOT inside `personal_site/`):
- `LinkedIn_Compiled/` — profile text (`experience.md`, `education.md`, `honors_and_credentials.md`,
  `skills_and_languages.md`, `courses.md`) and per-project folders `projects/<slug>/<slug>.md` + assets.
- `LinkedIn_Compiled/projects/rescue-vision/` — `hub.glb` source, `image.png` (the transform reference),
  and `rescueVision/include/dwm_geom.h` (authoritative IWR↔DWM transform).
- `Guadaloop/TestRig Current/` — rig CAD + `UsefulCrop.png` reference render.
- `BlindMaster/blinds_flutter/` — the BlindMaster Flutter app.
- Transcript for course numbers: `~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-…/Year 2/Academic Summary Sem2.pdf`.

Also: this agent keeps a private cross-session memory at
`/Users/adipu/.claude/projects/-Users-adipu-Personal-Site/memory/` (index `MEMORY.md` + per-fact files:
`landing-page`, `project-page-architecture`, `headless-verification`, `guadaloop-rig-lighting`,
`viewer-framework`, `rescuevision-viewer`). That memory and THIS doc should agree; this doc is the
git-tracked, agent-agnostic version — keep both current.

## 12. Changelog (what we've accomplished)

Newest first. Append an entry whenever you ship something.

- **2026-06-12** — **Landing page: skill popover closes on outside tap on mobile (iOS fix) + moved Skills right after
  the bio.** (1) **Mobile dismiss bug:** the skill-chip popover (`.skillpane`) only closed on scroll on mobile — tapping
  empty space did nothing. Root cause is the classic **iOS Safari quirk**: a `click` on a non-interactive area doesn't
  bubble to `document`, so the `addEventListener('click', closePane)` outside-close never fired on touch. Fix: also
  close on **`pointerdown`** (fires reliably for touches) — `addEventListener('pointerdown', closePane)` — and stop
  `pointerdown` from bubbling on both the **pane** and each **chip** (the chip guard is essential: without it an
  outside-`pointerdown`/same-chip tap would close-then-the-click-reopens, or the active class would be cleared before
  the chip's `click` toggle reads it). Kept the `click`/Esc/resize/scroll closers. (2) **Reorder:** moved the entire
  `<section id="skills">` to sit **right after `#about`** (the bio) — order is now about → skills → work → experience
  → honors → coursework → contact — and renumbered the `.idx` labels: Skills **02 — Toolkit**, Work **03 — Selected
  Work**, Experience **04**, Honors **05**, Coursework **06** (About 01 / Contact 07 unchanged). The popover JS is
  unaffected (it queries `#skills .chip` live + positions via `getBoundingClientRect`). **Verified headless**
  (`/private/tmp/skills_outside.cjs` touch emulation + `skills_desktop.cjs`): mobile chip-tap opens, outside-tap
  closes, inside-tap stays open, same-chip toggle closes; desktop click-open/outside-close still work; section order +
  renumbered idx confirmed; 0 console errors.
- **2026-06-12** — **Landing page: mobile nav menu (hamburger → full-screen overlay).** On mobile the nav previously
  hid all links except the Résumé button (`@media(max-width:860px){.navlinks a:not(.btn){display:none}}`) — so there
  was no way to reach Work/Experience/About/Contact. Added a proper mobile menu: a **hamburger toggle** (`#menuToggle`,
  3 `<span>` bars that animate into an X via `.open`) shown only ≤860px, and a **full-screen overlay** (`#mobileMenu`,
  `position:fixed; inset:0; z-index:49` — just **below** the nav's z-50 so the brand + X stay on top) with large
  uppercase links matching the site identity (`clamp(34px,11vw,52px)`, 800-weight, right-aligned `01–04` index numbers
  via `.mi`, **Résumé** in `--accent` with a ↗). The ≤860px block now does `.navlinks{display:none}` +
  `.menu-toggle{display:block}` (was hiding only non-btn links). JS (next to the nav-scroll handler): `setMenu(open)`
  toggles `.open` on both, syncs `aria-expanded`/`aria-hidden`/`aria-label`, and adds `body.menu-open{overflow:hidden}`
  to lock scroll; closes on link tap, **Esc**, or `resize` past 860px. **Verified headless** (`/private/tmp/menu_check.cjs`):
  desktop unchanged (navlinks flex, toggle none); mobile closed (navlinks none, toggle block, menu hidden); open
  (menu visible, aria-expanded true, body locked, all 5 links Work/Experience/About/Contact/Résumé); link tap
  navigates (`#work`) + closes + unlocks; 0 console errors; screenshots confirm the bold overlay + hamburger↔X.
- **2026-06-12** — **Removed the waggling "scroll ↓" hint; moved "Back to case study" to the screen bottom; BlindMaster
  mobile-portrait overlay reposition (+ a regression bugfix).** Three small UX asks, all verified headless. (1)
  **Dropped `#scrollhint`** (the bobbing "scroll ↓" at bottom-centre) from all four viewers: removed the `<div
  id="scrollhint">` markup, the `#scrollhint`/`@keyframes bob` CSS + the `body.editing #scrollhint` hide rule
  (`viewer.css`), the `disp('scrollhint',…)` call in `DockController.applyDock` (`engine.js`), and `'scrollhint'`
  from smartpt's tuner-hide list + blindmaster's `OVERLAY_IDS`. (2) **`#skipcase` ("↑ Back to case study") took its
  place** — moved from `bottom:54px`→**`8px`** desktop / `50px`→**`6px`** mobile (right at the screen edge, where the
  scroll hint used to be). (3) **BlindMaster portrait-mobile overlays repositioned** (`drawDims('drive')` slat glyph +
  the finale "SET POSITION" badge): on `COARSE && innerWidth<innerHeight` both now render **top-left** (glyph at
  `gx:16, gy:104`; badge at `left:16,top:80`) and **shrunk** (glyph 116×104 vs 168×150, number 28 vs 38px; badge 46 vs
  64px) so they don't collide with the bottom-right `#blurb`; desktop/landscape unchanged (lower-left, full size).
  **Regression caught + fixed:** the first BlindMaster edit used `COARSE` but it **wasn't in the file's `engine.js`
  import list** → `drawDims`/the finale threw `ReferenceError: COARSE is not defined` every frame during the drive &
  finale beats, which propagated out of the storyboard resolve in `tick()` and **broke/froze those beats** (the user's
  "storyboard beats jumbled up / everything slightly broken"). Fixed by adding `COARSE` to the import. **Lesson:**
  `engine.js` exports are explicitly imported per viewer — when reusing a shared const (`COARSE`, `DEV`, etc.) in a
  viewer, check it's in that file's import list first. **Verified** (`/private/tmp/bm_check.cjs` seeking real
  storyboard progress via the `#dev` HUD + `/private/tmp/all_smoke.cjs`): 0 console errors across all four viewers
  full-sweep; desktop drive beat unchanged (slat window lower-left); mobile drive + finale overlays top-left, clear of
  the nav and blurb.
- **2026-06-12** — **Harmonium hero: thumbnail of the live app + the hero box itself links to the live demo (dropped
  the "Live demo" button).** The user wanted the `.hero-media` to be a clickable link to the live site
  (`https://tvg-vibeathon.vercel.app`) showing a **site thumbnail**, and the redundant "Live demo ↗" `.btn` removed.
  No harmonium image existed; the user supplied a screenshot of the app in use (playing piano via webcam hand-tracking
  — far better than the plain gradient landing page I'd captured, since it shows what the project *does*). It was a
  3 MB **`Display P3`** PNG (2428×1346); baked it to **sRGB JPEG** resized to 1400w (q82, **142 KB**) at
  `assets/projects/harmonium/hero.jpeg` via `sips --matchTo … sRGB --resampleWidth 1400 -s format jpeg`. Markup: the
  hero `<div class="hero-media reveal">` (was an `.abstract` placeholder) is now
  `<a class="hero-media reveal" href=… target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Open the live Harmonium demo">` wrapping
  the `<img>` + the existing `.cap` "Try it live ↗"; removed the `.btn-solid` "Live demo ↗" from `.actions` (now just
  GitHub + Watch demo). **Shared CSS** (`project.css`): added a clickable-hero affordance — `a.hero-media{display:block;
  cursor:pointer}` + hover (`translateY(-2px)`, accent border, inner `img` `scale(1.04)` ken-burns, `.cap` brightens).
  (An `<a>` that's a direct grid item is auto-blockified, but set `display:block` explicitly.) Reusable for any future
  project whose hero should link to a live site. **Verified headless**: hero is an `<a>`→the demo URL (new tab,
  `cursor:pointer`), thumbnail loads 1400×776, no `.abstract`, actions = [GitHub, Watch demo], caption legible, no
  console errors; screenshot confirms the crop keeps the face + central piano keys.
- **2026-06-12** — **Fixed a washed-out hero image (HDR/PQ JPEG → sRGB) + made the hero-media `.cap` legible.**
  The user replicated the tweinstein hero-media reveal on **lidar-slam** and the photo looked badly washed-out in
  the browser vs Apple Preview, and asked "does it have HDR?". It does: `sips -g profile` on
  `assets/projects/lidar-slam/1755029891520.jpeg` reported **`Display P3 Primaries; PQ (Adaptive Gain Curve …)`** —
  an Apple **HDR** JPEG (PQ transfer + gain map). Preview is HDR/ColorSync-aware (renders the gain map → vibrant);
  browsers show the PQ/SDR base and it reads flat/washed-out. **Fix:** baked it to plain **sRGB SDR** via
  `sips --matchTo '/System/Library/ColorSync/Profiles/sRGB Profile.icc' …` (ColorSync tone-maps PQ→sRGB); confirmed
  the result profile is `sRGB IEC61966-2.1` and visually A/B'd (orig flat vs converted = richer contrast/greens).
  Replaced the repo file in place (102 KB→165 KB; original backed up at `/private/tmp/lidar_hero.orig.jpeg`). Scanned
  ALL site images: only this one was HDR/PQ. Two others are **`Display P3`** (wide-gamut **SDR** — `smartpt/stagePic`,
  `tweinstein/tw_team`); browsers color-manage those correctly, so left as-is. **Second part — caption legibility:**
  the user noticed the tweinstein hero caption only now (it "blends right into the image"). The shared
  `.hero-media .cap` was `position:absolute` over the photo with `color:var(--faint)` (rgba .32) and **no background**
  → invisible on busy images. Restyled it in `assets/project.css` as a **defined glass chip**: brighter text
  (rgba .95), `background:rgba(10,11,14,.6)` + `backdrop-filter:blur(8px) saturate(1.2)` (+ `-webkit-`), subtle
  border, `border-radius:8px` (rounded-rect, not a pill, so long captions wrap cleanly to 2 lines), `padding:6px 11px`,
  `max-width:calc(100% - 24px)`. One shared rule → every hero caption (tweinstein, lidar-slam, harmonium, archive)
  now reads clearly. **Verified headless** (element screenshots): lidar-slam hero no longer washed out + caption chip
  legible (wraps to 2 lines), tweinstein "RACE DAY · 1ST PLACE 🏆" chip legible, no console errors.
- **2026-06-12** — **Guadaloop case study: added a small "The team" photo gallery + gave ALL `.gallery`s visible
  captions.** The user supplied two non-critical 1920×1080 team photos (`assets/projects/guadaloop/1777311336462.jpeg`
  = teammate Neha Ramachandran working on the test rig; `…168.jpeg` = the whole Texas Guadaloop team doing the hand
  sign) and asked to place them tastefully without pulling focus from the technical content. Added a `section.block`
  titled **"The team"** using the shared **`.gallery`** module (the same compact 2-up responsive grid
  `tweinstein.html` uses — `repeat(auto-fit,minmax(220px,1fr))`, 4:3 `object-fit:cover`, stacks to 1 col on phones),
  with `loading="lazy"`. Placed **after "Results & honest limits" and before "Videos"** so the technical narrative
  leads and the human/team context sits low. **Then (follow-up): captions.** The user noted alt text isn't easily
  visible and asked for a caption under all galleries describing what's going on — so I changed the shared
  **`.gallery` CSS** (`assets/project.css`) to support a visible `figcaption`: dropped the old
  `figure{aspect-ratio:4/3; position:relative}` + `img{position:absolute; inset:0}` (which had no room for a caption)
  in favour of `img{width:100%; aspect-ratio:4/3; object-fit:cover}` (the box now sizes to the image) + a new
  `.gallery figcaption{padding:10px 14px; font-size:13px; color:var(--muted); border-top:1px solid var(--line)}`
  (matching the existing `.figure figcaption` treatment). Then added `<figcaption>`s to **both** galleries
  (Guadaloop's two team photos + TweinStein's two race-day photos). Captionless galleries still render fine (just no
  caption bar). No new module — one shared CSS change covers every current + future gallery. Verified headless
  (puppeteer): section order Problem→Overview→Decisions→Results→**The team**→Videos, images load 1920×1080, captions
  present + legible as a divider-topped muted bar under each photo on both pages, no console errors. *(Notes: `/tmp`
  puppeteer was wiped — `package.json` gone — so `npm i puppeteer-core@23` in `/private/tmp` was needed again; and a
  puppeteer gotcha: `screenshot({clip})` is **document-relative**, so to capture a scrolled element either set
  `clip.y` to its document offset, or omit `clip` and screenshot the viewport after `scrollIntoView` — or
  `elementHandle.screenshot()` for a tight crop.)*
- **2026-06-11** — **Standardized the viewer case-study top area to match the non-viewer project pages (all 4
  viewers).** The user asked that the viewers' docked case studies replicate the layout the non-viewer pages
  (`projects/*.html`) already do better: **media shown as actual embedded video players** (not bare link buttons),
  and the **GitHub/external links in their own strip at the top**, right under the title section (above the facts) —
  the section needs no explicit "Links" heading, it's inferred from its contents. Done in two passes (the first put
  the links *after* facts — the user corrected: on the non-viewer pages `.actions` lives in the hero **above** the
  facts). Final standardized top-of-case order, identical to `tweinstein.html` et al: **`.award` pill → `.lede` →
  `.tags` (tech-stack chips) → `.actions` (links) → `dl.facts` → content**. Changes per viewer (`viewers/*/index.html`):
  (1) **Tags chips** — added a `.tags reveal` row of `.tag` chips after the lede (5 each): RescueVision/SmartPT/
  BlindMaster reuse the exact chips from their matching non-viewer page; **Guadaloop** (which has no non-viewer page)
  got crafted ones from its stack (`Ansys FEA · SciKit-Learn · PyBullet · Gymnasium · PID·LQR·RL`). (2) **Links strip**
  — added a `.actions reveal` strip on **every** viewer between tags and facts. *(I initially gave RescueVision none /
  SmartPT placeholders; the **user then filled in the real links**: **RescueVision** + **SmartPT** = GitHub · DevPost ·
  LinkedIn Post; **Guadaloop** + **BlindMaster** = GitHub.)* (3) **Videos embedded** — replaced each bottom
  "Media"/"Media & artifacts" `.btn`-link section with a **"Videos"** section of real `.videowrap > iframe` YouTube
  players + a `<figcaption>` per clip: RescueVision 3 (hackathon 1:39 / short 0:56 / IWR bring-up 1:02), Guadaloop 3
  (walkthrough 8:22 / clean run 0:08 / early instability 0:42), SmartPT 2 (hackathon demo / walkthrough). BlindMaster
  had only a GitHub link (no videos) so its "Media" section was removed entirely (the link now lives in the top
  `.actions` strip). All chrome is the **shared `assets/project.css`** (`.tags/.tag/.actions/.btn/.videowrap` already
  defined) — no new CSS. **Verified headless** (puppeteer): DOM order award→lede→tags(5)→actions→facts on all four,
  iframe `src`s correct, and rendered screenshots confirm the links strip sits under the title and the video players
  embed with thumbnails + captions.
- **2026-06-11** — **Two inverted-flow UI tweaks: "Explore in 3D" pill moved INSIDE the floater card; mobile
  defaults to a MINIMISED model (no top gap).** (1) **Pill inside:** `#dockhint` now floats at the bottom *inside*
  the docked card (was a chip *below* it) — `viewer.css` `transform: translate(-50%,-100%)` (anchored by its own
  bottom edge) + `applyDock` positions it at `top = R.top + R.h − 14`, centred on the card. (2) **Mobile minimised
  default:** removed the `body article#case{padding-top:408px}` gap hack; instead the model now **starts minimised
  (the "‹ 3D" edge tab)** on phones, so the case study fills the top cleanly (less clutter than a near-full-width
  card). New helper `narrowVP() = () => matchMedia('(max-width:640px)').matches` in `engine.js`: the `DockController`
  constructor sets `this.collapsed = narrowVP()`; the scroll auto-restore is now **desktop-only** (`&& !narrowVP()`)
  so the model stays minimised the whole time it's docked over the case study (incl. after **"Back to case study"**,
  which now sets `this.collapsed = narrowVP()` to re-minimise on phones rather than `expand()`). **Phone collapse =
  hide-in-place-fade, not the desktop slide-off-right:** the desktop `#c.docked.collapsed{transform:translateX(100%+30px)}`
  + `.38s` transition made the model "fly in from the corner" when you scrolled into the un-dock zone on a phone; so
  `viewer.css` overrides it under `@media(max-width:640px)` to `#c.docked{transition:opacity .25s}` +
  `#c.docked.collapsed{transform:none;opacity:0}` — the un-dock now reveals the model **fading + growing from the
  card** (matching desktop's grow), not sliding in. **Verified** (`/private/tmp/twochk.cjs` + `invert.cjs`): desktop
  pill fully inside the card (bottom-centre, `pillInsideCard:true`); all 4 viewers regression-clean (top docked,
  floater-click → visualizer start within 2px, back-to-case, no console errors); mobile 390px = case study fills the
  top with **no gap** + "‹ 3D" tab (award at y=127, casePadTop 15vh), and scrolling into the un-dock zone shows the
  model **on-screen growing** (canvas left 12 — previously a buggy off-screen 412 from the slide animation).
  *(The user separately reworded the Guadaloop lede, resolving the "rig above" copy nit — §15.)*
- **2026-06-11** — **Fixed a subtle model-size "pop" at the start of the floater enlarging (inverted flow).** The
  user noticed the model abruptly expands a little just as the floater begins to enlarge. **Root cause:**
  `DockController.update()` framed the docked rotisserie at a hardcoded **`fit: 2.0`**, but the storyboard branch it
  hands off to at `dockK = DOCK_SETTLE (0.8)` resolves the **intro** chapter (`fit` ~1.6; 1.7 on SmartPT) — and the
  `spinKeep` hand-off only blended the *azimuth*, never the *distance* — so at exactly `dockK=0.8` the fit jumped
  discontinuously (2.0→1.6 ≈ **25%**, ~18% SmartPT), i.e. the model popped bigger right as the canvas started growing.
  This didn't happen pre-inversion because the dock was adjacent to the **settle** chapter, which was deliberately
  `fit: 2.0` *to match the rotisserie*; the inversion put the **intro** chapter (fit 1.6/1.7) adjacent instead, breaking
  that match. **Fix (shared, ~10 lines in the rotisserie branch):** resolve the storyboard's resting frame via
  `onStory(this.shownProgress)` (the *same* frame the un-dock hands off to — also keeps the docked model in its intro
  part-state), capture its camera offset (`_soff`), and **blend the camera offset story↔card-fit-2.0 by `spinKeep`**
  (the same factor that already blends the spin), then apply the azimuth spin. So the framing distance is now
  **continuous across `[0.8, 1.0]`** (intro fit at the `dockK=0.8` hand-off → fit-2.0 when fully docked), while the
  card still settles at its composed fit-2.0 margins. Added one scratch vector `_soff`. No per-viewer edits.
  **Verified** (`/private/tmp/popshot.cjs`): the dockK-0.81-vs-0.79 A/B (near-identical canvas size) that previously
  showed a clear ~25% jump now shows the model at the **same size**; full-dock `dockK=0.99` still shows the small
  fit-2.0 card. All four viewers regression-clean (`/private/tmp/invert.cjs`: top docked + "Explore in 3D ↓" hint,
  floater-click → visualizer start within 2px, back-to-case → top, **no console errors**).
- **2026-06-11** — **INVERTED the viewer flow on all four viewers: case study FIRST, 3D walkthrough AFTER.**
  The user asked to lead with the case study (styled like every other case-study page) with the 3D model as a
  **floater in the top-right** over it; then, scrolling to the bottom of the case study, the floater **enlarges**
  (reusing the existing rotation ramp to settle from the carousel pose back to iso), the **hero title fades in**
  once it's full-screen, and the storyboard plays "as usual." Implemented as an **inversion of the existing dock
  machinery** (not a rebuild) — almost everything was reused. Changes: **(1) DockController scroll math inverted**
  (`engine.js`): `layout()` now computes `_storyStart = spacer.offsetTop`, `_storySpan = spacer.offsetHeight −
  innerHeight`, and a short `_undockSpan = min(0.9·innerHeight, 0.5·storySpan)`; `_onScroll()` sets
  `dockK = clamp01(1 − (scrollY − _storyStart)/_undockSpan)` (1 while reading the case study, ramping 1→0 across the
  un-dock zone at the spacer's start) and `progress = clamp01((x − _undockSpan)/(_storySpan − _undockSpan))` (the
  storyboard runs AFTER the un-dock zone). The `update()` rotisserie + overlay-fade (`od = 1 − smoothstep(dockK)`)
  and the `spinKeep/wrapPi` two-way rotation hand-off were left as-is — they already do the enlarge + rotation ramp,
  just at the new scroll positions. **(2) DOM reorder** — `<article id="case">` now comes **BEFORE** `#spacer` in all
  four `index.html` (the canvas/overlays are `position:fixed`, so only these two flow elements moved). **(3) Dock UI
  repurposed**: `replay()`→**`enterVisualizer()`** (clicking the floater `#dockwin` smooth-scrolls DOWN to
  `_storyStart + _undockSpan` = the visualizer start; the smooth-scroll passes through the un-dock zone so the model
  grows + title fades in on the way); `skipToCase()`→**`backToCase()`** (smooth-scroll to top); `#skipcase` relabeled
  **"↑ Back to case study"** (its existing `disp('skipcase', k>0.03)` trigger already shows it during the walkthrough
  / hides it while docked — perfect for the inverted flow); `#dockhint` repurposed as the **"Explore in 3D ↓"** hint
  chip (text set in `_buildDockUI`; restyled in `viewer.css` as a soft-pulsing glass pill — `@keyframes explorePulse`
  glow + `hintbob` arrow bob — centred under the card by `applyDock`, shown when `dockK>0.7`). **(4) Hero title
  fade-in** (`Storyboard`): added `hero.fadeIn` (default **0.03**); `updateOverlays` now sets title
  `opacity = smoothstep(p/fadeIn)` and holds it still (`translateY 0`) through the fade, THEN rises — so the title
  appears strictly AFTER the floater reaches full screen (progress only advances past 0 once dockK=0). **(5) Dock on
  load**: the constructor now calls `applyDock(this.dockK)` so the model is already in its corner card on load (no
  full-screen flash while reading the case study). **(6) Mobile** (`viewer.css`): the floater is near-full-width on
  phones, so a shared `body article#case { padding-top: 408px }` (`@media max-width:640px`, higher specificity than
  each viewer's inline `#case`) starts the case content BELOW the floater + chip → a clean **hero-card → article**
  layout (was: lede hidden behind the card). **BlindMaster's finale fade needed NO change** — it's keyed to
  `dock.progress` (raw scroll), not a bottom dock (which no longer exists; the visualizer is now the finale and just
  ends full-screen). **Verified headless across all four** (`/private/tmp/invert.cjs`): DOM order (`spacerAfterCase`),
  top = docked 380×280 card top-right + "Explore in 3D ↓" hint @ opacity 1 + "Back to case study" hidden + title @ 0
  + case at top; un-dock midpoint = canvas growing (890×640); intro = full-screen + "Back to case study" visible +
  title fading in (0.01→0.24→0.86 across the fade window); **floater-click → visualizer start** (within 2px of
  `_storyStart+_undockSpan` on every viewer); **back-to-case → 0**; no console errors anywhere. Mobile 390px confirmed
  (`/private/tmp/mobtop.cjs`): hero-card → article, lede no longer occluded. *(Harness gotcha: the site sets
  `html{scroll-behavior:smooth}` (project.css), so the test must inject `html{scroll-behavior:auto}` or instant
  `scrollTo` reads mid-animation.)* **Open copy nit (see §15):** Guadaloop's lede still says "The rig **above** is the
  hard part to control" — with the inverted layout the rig is the top-right floater / the walkthrough is *below*, not
  above, so that word now reads wrong; left for the user to reword (their voice).
- **2026-06-11** — **Shared "Skip to case study" control on every 3D walkthrough.** The user asked for a skip
  option on all viewers that "scrolls directly to case study start (dock start)". Built once in the shared
  **`DockController`** so all four viewers inherit it: `_buildDockUI()` now also creates **`#skipcase`** ("Skip
  to case study ↓"), and **`skipToCase()`** smooth-scrolls straight to the **top of `#case`** — the scroll
  position where `dockK` reaches 1, i.e. the model has docked into its top-right corner card and the case-study
  heading is at the viewport top (falls back to the dock-complete scroll position `_storyEnd + innerHeight*0.25`
  if a viewer lacks `#case`). *(Chose the case-study top over the literal dockK=0 "dock start" because at dockK=0
  the model is still full-screen and the case study isn't visible yet — landing there wouldn't "skip to the case
  study"; smooth-scrolling to the case top still fast-forwards the dock animation on the way down.)* Visibility:
  `applyDock` toggles it with the same `disp('skipcase', k>0.03)` trigger as `#scrollhint`/`#hint`, so it shows
  throughout the walkthrough and disappears once docking begins (and auto-reappears if you scroll back up / hit
  replay). Styled in `viewer.css` as a **glass chip** (matching the nav chips: blur + tint + accent ↓) pinned
  **bottom-center just above `#scrollhint`** — a deliberately non-conflicting spot (the right rail holds
  `#panel`/`#blurb`, the top corners hold the nav/brand, and center-bottom-over-the-model is already the
  `#scrollhint` safe zone). `body.editing #skipcase{display:none}` hides it in the editor; a `@media(max-width:640px)`
  tweak slims it on phones. **User-facing, NOT dev-gated** (unlike the HUD/hint). **Verified headless across all
  four viewers** (`/private/tmp/skipcheck.cjs` + screenshots): chip present/visible at the top, click lands the
  scroll **exactly at `#case` top** (model docked, `#c.docked`, case heading at viewport top, chip hidden), no
  console errors; screenshots confirm clean placement above the scroll hint at the intro AND no collision with
  the side blurb at a mid beat.
- **2026-06-11** — **Landing hero CTA relabel** (`index.html`). The user asked to rename the hero's primary
  CTA from **"View Work →" to "View Projects →"** (the `#work` section is actually the *projects* grid —
  "02 — Selected Work") and to add a **"Work history"** button next to it. Wired the new button to
  **`#experience`** (the "03 — Experience" timeline = his actual work history), keeping it a plain `.btn`
  beside the solid primary. CTA row is now `View Projects → · Work history · Résumé · Get in touch`. Verified
  headless at 1280px (single clean row) and 390px (wraps to a tidy 2×2) — labels + hrefs confirmed in the DOM.
- **2026-06-11** — **Shared dev-mode gate — hide the "x%" HUD + the press-G editor in production (all viewers).**
  The user asked to gate the top-left **`#hud-progress` "x%"** readout and the **press-G** part-grouping /
  appearance editor behind a dev mode, "ideally a fix that reaches across all viewers" with shared code moved
  into `viewers/shared/`. Done as **one shared flag** rather than per-viewer toggles: added **`export const DEV`**
  to `engine.js` (computed once at module load) — `#dev`/`?dev` in the URL turns it on and **persists via
  `localStorage['viewerDev']`**; `#nodev`/`?dev=0` turns it off; otherwise it reads localStorage. When on, engine
  adds a **`.dev` class to `<body>`** (on DOMContentLoaded). `viewer.css` now sets `#hud-progress`/`#hint`
  `display:none` **by default** and reveals them only off **`body.dev`** (so casual visitors see neither). The
  **G-key listeners are registered only when `DEV`**: `appearance.js` wraps its keydown in `if (DEV)` (covers
  RescueVision + SmartPT, which use `AppearanceEditor`), and the inline grouping-editor handlers in
  `guadaloop/index.html` + `blindmaster/index.html` became `if (DEV) addEventListener(...)` (both now also import
  `DEV`). The editors' click/pointer handlers already early-return on `!editor.on`/`!this.on`, so with G inert they
  stay dormant. **Verified headless across all four viewers** (`/private/tmp/devcheck.cjs`): production = body not
  `.dev`, HUD+hint `display:none`, G does nothing; `#dev` = `body.dev`, both shown, G opens the editor; a plain
  reload **persists** (localStorage); `#nodev` clears it back to hidden — no console errors anywhere. *(Gotcha
  surfaced: a **hash-only** nav doesn't reload the page, so the module won't re-evaluate `#dev` — the test had to
  force a full `about:blank`→URL load; same applies in real use: add `#dev` then reload.)*
- **2026-06-11** — **Guadaloop viewer tied into the LevSim case study (dock-to-case-study) + a long-standing
  DockController load bug fixed.** The guadaloop rig viewer was the last no-dock viewer; it now docks like the
  others into the **LevSim** sim-environment write-up (source `Guadaloop/Lev-Sim.md` + `System.md` dataflow).
  Changes to `viewers/guadaloop/index.html`: linked `assets/project.css`; moved the `1500vh` scroll height off
  `body` onto a new `#spacer`; added `#dockhint` + an `<article id="case">` (shared `.award/.lede/.facts/.block/
  .dives/footer` identity) with a **redrawn SVG architecture diagram** of the LevSim dataflow (offline *Ansys FEA
  → force/torque LUT → polynomial `Maglev_Model.pkl`*; runtime hub-and-spoke around **`Lev_pod_env.py`** @ 240 Hz
  ⇄ PyBullet, MagLev Predictor, Controllers PID/LQR/RL, `maglev_coil.py`); created a `DockController` in `start()`
  and replaced the hand-rolled `scroll`→`progress` handler + `tick()` smoothing with `dock.update()`; split the
  finale into movement `[0.91,0.97]` + a `fit:2.0` **settle** `[0.97,1.00]` to match the docked-card framing. The
  grouping editor (G) still works — `exitEdit` resolves at `dock.shownProgress`, and `enterEdit` restores a
  full-screen canvas so it opens correctly even when pressed while docked. Nav label/title now say "Test Rig +
  LevSim"; the landing card already read "…Test Rig + Sim Env". **Root-cause fix in the shared `DockController`
  (helps ALL docking viewers):** the constructor never initialised `dockK`/`progress` from the *current* scroll —
  only the scroll listener set them — so a **reload while scrolled into the case study** left `dockK=0` and rendered
  the full-screen storyboard "active" behind `#case` until any scroll input nudged it (the user flagged: "any scroll
  input is necessary and sufficient to get the rendering to figure out the model shouldn't be active"). Now
  `this._onScroll(); this.shownProgress = this.progress;` runs in the constructor, so a scrolled load docks
  immediately (verified deterministically by scrolling on DOMContentLoaded *before* the listener exists). Also
  `viewer.css` now hides `#case/#dockhint/#dockwin/#docktab` under `body.editing` (the editor canvas is z1, `#case`
  is z5 — it was painting over the full-screen editor). Verified headless: storyboard intact, clean dock hand-off,
  diagram legible, editor full-screen with group colours, no console errors; the other 3 viewers still load clean
  and aren't docked at top. *(Lesson: don't conflate the editor's z-index occlusion with the dock-init-on-load bug —
  they're separate; the user caught the conflation.)*
- **2026-06-11** — **BlindMaster finale fade fix (second pass — correct fix).** Root cause chain: `DockController.update()` passes `shownProgress` (= `p` in `onResolve`) rather than raw `progress`; `shownProgress` is exponentially smoothed with factor 0.12, so it significantly LAGS raw scroll. dockK=0 (canvas starts shrinking) maps to rawP≈0.961. By that point, `shownProgress` can still be 0.96 or less, keeping `finFade` near 1; the canvas then shrinks with the labels still visible. First fix attempt used `dkFade = 1 - smoothstep(dK/0.5)` (fade over dockK 0→0.5) but at dockK=0.02 (first visible shrink) dkFade≈0.995 — still essentially 1, so the fade only became visible well INTO the shrink. **Correct fix**: use `dock.progress` (un-smoothed rawP) directly — `finFade = 1 - smoothstep(clamp01((rawP - 0.92) / 0.04))`. Fade runs rawP 0.92→0.96; since dockK=0 is at rawP≈0.961, finFade is 0 BEFORE the canvas starts shrinking for any scroll speed. For a typical scroller rawP≈shownP so the fade aligns with the panel/"END TO END" text fade (localT≈0.72 of finale beat, p≈0.932). No shared code changes needed.
- **2026-06-11** — **BlindMaster storyboard COMPLETE — remaining beats built (dims / plate lift / finale).** (1)
  **Dimension call-outs** (`drawDims('size')` + `dimSeg`): one leader+pill per axis (W red / H green / D blue,
  `.ax-x/.ax-y/.ax-z`), projected from `boxes.all` so they track the model as it pans; skips an axis if its
  projected edge is <24px (edge-on). (2) **Mounting plate = linear lift** (the user rejected a hinge rotation):
  `buildPlateLift`/`liftPlate(dy)` translate the `plate` movers along world +Y on `PLATE_LIFT·S·sin(π·localT)`
  (up then neatly back down; 0 at the beat edges). (3) **Full-stack finale** (`buildFinale`/`updateFinale`/
  `finalePos`/`hideFinale`): the device is the HUB; a transparent **phone glides in**, an Express **server** node
  sits between, **command dots flow app→server→hub** (server-as-relay), a dashed orange **BLE arc** links phone→hub,
  and a live **`set position N`** cycles `FIN_TARGETS=[7,2,9,5]` — turning the hub's external hook via the drivetrain
  gears. Framed on a computed `boxes.finale` (device+phone+server), `fit 1.45`. Labels are a **separate `#finlabels`
  overlay div** (NOT `#dims`, so the storyboard's dims-fade doesn't touch it): legible dark-pill chips +
  a big lower-left **SET POSITION** badge (orange glow pulse per fresh command). (4) **Finale fade (bidirectional):**
  the actors+labels are driven from `FIN_START 0.86` through the settle + dock and fade by `1 − smoothstep(dockK/0.8)`
  — **/0.8 because the DockController stops calling `onStory` at `dockK ≥ DOCK_SETTLE(0.8)`** (rotisserie hand-off),
  so they must reach 0 by then or they'd freeze in the docked window. Finale meshes made `transparent` so they fade;
  the gear `lerp(5, finalePos(ft), finFade)` eases the hook back to open as it docks. Verified: no console errors
  across the finale+dock range. *(The user fixed the drivetrain readout clipping themselves — the case-study SVG's
  global `svg text{text-anchor:middle}` was leaking onto `#dims`; forced `text-anchor:start` on the readout text.)*
- **2026-06-10** — **BlindMaster: corrected GLB (XIAO fixed at source) + name-rules restored + grouping editor.**
  After the XIAO-placement thrash, the user fixed it in CAD and re-exported. Two iterations: `plswork.glb`
  (XIAO un-exploded BUT merged into 28 anonymous "Part_NN" meshes — name rules dead, and the upper shell + mounting
  plate + hook were one merged part, so the plate couldn't be separated) → then **`pls2'.glb`** (113 meshes, **original
  descriptive CAD names back** — `CR Servo`, `hook with gear`, `Encoder gear`, `Encoder EC12E24204A2`, `BlindsBottomHook`,
  `BoxTop`/`BoxBottom` **separate**, `xiaoPCB placeholder`, etc. — and the XIAO **in place**, depth shrank 63→**40 mm**).
  Copied `pls2'.glb` → **`servobox.glb`** (canonical; the viewer loads that). **Restored name-based classification**
  as `ruleClassify(o)` (the original compacted-name regex rules) and made `classify = GROUPS[name] (override) →
  ruleClassify → 'other'` — the **Guadaloop rule+override pattern**. **Built a grouping editor** (press **G**) as the
  override layer for any straggler: orbit, pick an active group (swatch or number key 0–9), click parts to paint them,
  **E** exports `groups.json` (`{groups:{partName:group}}`); replaced the old AppearanceEditor on G (the old
  `appearance.json` keyed by the dead mesh names is now stale/unused — re-dress later if wanted; the GLB ships its own
  per-part materials). Removed `placeXiao` (XIAO no longer exploded) + the `#soloxiao` debug. Updated the form-factor
  copy to 40 mm and the drivetrain copy to "half a gear turn". **Verified** on the corrected GLB: `#dbg` shows correct
  groups (plate now separate from box), the drivetrain beat animates (gears spin, POSITION 2/10 · 26 ticks · 1.1 turns,
  bottom hook static), XIAO sits in the box, no console errors. **Lesson:** when the model's part granularity/topology
  is wrong, fixing it at the CAD source beats fighting it in code — and don't make destructive edits (dropping/hiding
  parts) the user didn't ask for. *(Stale files in the folder: `plswork.glb`, `pls2'.glb`, `appearance.json` — safe to
  delete; the inspector `_inspect.html` gained `?glb=/?only=/?hide=/?tint=/?rainbow=/?reassemble=` flags.)*
- **2026-06-10** — **BlindMaster XIAO REASSEMBLED (not dropped) — the correct fix.** The user (rightly) pushed
  back: "replace the XIAO" meant *reassemble it from its constituent parts*, NOT delete it — and dropping it was a
  bad, unrequested edit. Restored the module and built **`placeXiao(model)`** to reassemble the **exploded** XIAO:
  inspection (via the upgraded `_inspect.html` `?only=/?tint=/?frame=/?reassemble=` flags + `/private/tmp/bm_iso2.cjs,
  bm_reasm.cjs, bm_combo.cjs`) showed the XIAO's **PCB + silver RF shield + U.FL** floated out to the back (worldZ ≈
  −0.030) while its **USB-C body + sockets stayed on the carrier PCB** — and the board's normal is **perpendicular**
  to the carrier (board ⟂ Z, carrier ⟂ X). So the floating cluster (xiao meshes with worldZ < −0.012) is rotated
  **−90° about Y** (board normal Z → X, so it lies FLUSH on the carrier with the silver shield + label facing the
  camera) and translated so its centroid lands on the carrier centre (+X, the camera side). Implemented as a rigid
  world transform (`local = parentInv · W · base`, decomposed) applied at load before framing; `boxes.elecTop` =
  xiao ∪ pcb ∪ servo again. **Live tuner `#xiao=dx,dy,dz,yaw,flip`** (mm · deg-about-Y · 0|1 extra 180° about X) for
  the user to perfect the exact hole-to-tab seating (the 4 board holes seat on the USB-C's 4 tabs). Verified isolated
  (shield faces viewport, USB-C protrudes, flush with carrier) AND in the viewer (no floating board in the intro;
  reassembled module in the elecTop beat). *(Supersedes the two prior "drop the xiao group" entries below.)* Known
  polish: the translucent orange enclosure makes the elecTop beat murky — consider a lower box opacity for the
  electronics beats so the XIAO reads.
- **2026-06-10** — **BlindMaster XIAO-disappeared bugfix (classify ordering).** The user caught that the XIAO
  *and* its board had vanished entirely — a verification miss from round 2 (I saw green boards in the elecTop
  render and wrongly assumed the labeled placeholder survived; it was actually top/bottom PCBs). **Root cause:**
  `classify()` ran the `/seeed|xiao|esp32c6|esp32s3/ → 'xiao'` rule BEFORE the `pcb` rule, and `xiaoPCB_placeholder`
  contains "xiao" (compacts to `xiaopcbplaceholder1`), so the in-box stand-in was swept into the `xiao` group — and
  my "drop the `xiao` group" filter deleted it along with the exploded module. **Fix:** added
  `if (/xiaopcbplaceholder/.test(p)) return 'pcb';` **before** the `xiao` rule (and removed `xiaopcbplaceholder` from
  the later `pcb` rule). Now `xiao` = only the exploded Seeed module (dropped) and the labeled placeholder stays in
  `pcb` (kept + framed). Verified: intro has no floating board, elecTop frames the labeled green board. *(Lesson:
  when a name-substring rule precedes a more specific one, the broad rule wins — order specific→general, and when
  verifying a deletion, confirm the SURVIVOR by identity, not by colour.)*
- **2026-06-10** — **BlindMaster round 2: drivetrain retune + XIAO reconstitution + appearance + case-study sync +
  landing wiring** (all per the user's feedback, verified headless). (1) **Drivetrain timing:** `STEP_TURNS`
  1.0→**0.5** (1 step = half a turn), gear rotation now **anchored at pos 5** (`ang = (pos−5)·STEP_TURNS·2π`) so the
  resting/assembled pose is the model's base orientation (readout turns/ticks halve — pos 4 now reads 2.0 turns / 47
  ticks). `POS_KEYS` trimmed to `5→0→10→5` (≈1.5 gentle passes, middle 0→10 gets most of the scroll) → ~3× slower
  gear spin per scroll; both endpoints + rest sit at base ⇒ still no snap. (2) **XIAO reconstitution:** the detailed
  Seeed module is modeled **exploded** (board + RF shield flew out to the back-right, z≈−0.030). The **`xiaoPCB
  placeholder`** (in the `pcb` group) already sits correctly inside the box AND carries the **"seeed studio · ESP32C6"
  silkscreen label**, so it's the right stand-in. Now drop the whole `xiao` vis-group at load (`meshes.filter(...
  vis!=='xiao')`, `visible=false`) and frame `boxes.elecTop = pcb ∪ servo`. (3) **Appearance:** the user pasted
  `viewers/blindmaster/appearance.json` (BoxTop/BoxBottom/BatteryHolder = **Accent orange (9)**, both hooks = **Signal
  blue (11)**, LiPo = Grey nylon (4), servo = Steel (6)) — already wired via `applyAppearance`; loads clean (404 gone).
  *(Palette is 0-indexed: 9=orange, 10=red, 11=blue.)* (4) **Case-study sync:** ported the **System-architecture SVG**
  + patterns list + highlight dives + status from `projects/blindmaster.html` into the viewer's `#case` (Overview →
  System architecture → Highlights → Status). (5) **Landing wiring:** the BlindMaster **featured card** now
  `href="viewers/blindmaster/index.html"` + `.d3` 3D badge + "Open the 3D walkthrough →"; the skill-popover `PROJECTS`
  map entry repointed too. Verified: gears retimed, no floating board, appearance applied, case diagram renders, card DOM correct.
- **2026-06-10** — **BlindMaster viewer: design locked + foundation built & verified** (`viewers/blindmaster/`).
  The user gave a storyboard for the smart-blinds hub (`servobox.glb`) and asked which other segments fit.
  Researched the model (rendered/measured it via a throwaway `_inspect.html` + `/private/tmp/bm_inspect.cjs`
  — the GLB's POSITION accessors have **no min/max**, so JSON-only bounds collapse to ~0; must load through
  three.js) AND the firmware (`BlindMaster/Blinds_XIAO`). **Key firmware findings that shaped the storyboard:**
  the 11-position model (`Calibration::convertToTicks`) is a **linear tilt sweep** across the calibrated tick
  range — 0 = slats closed-down, **5 = flat/open**, 10 = closed-up (venetian *tilt*, not raise/lower), spanning
  **several gear turns**; and the **two EC12 encoders** are `topEnc` (tracks the motor-driven gear) + `bottomEnc`
  (a **manual wand** — turn the blind by hand and the servo follows via `baseDiff`/`effDiff` in `servo.cpp`). So
  the user's "mechanism back-and-forth" beat and a new "11-position payoff" beat **unify into one tilt-sweep act**.
  Agreed extra beats with the user (all three): (A) 11-position payoff, (B) full-stack finale **last**, (C) a
  power micro-beat folded into the battery view; plus the mounting plate as its own small hinge beat. **Built the
  foundation** `viewers/blindmaster/index.html` from the RescueVision template: `classify()` for 12 vis-groups
  (`servo/drive/encgear/enc/bottomhook/xiao/battery/power/pcb/box/plate/other`), orientation (the GLB ships
  **Y-up already** — mounting hook toward +Y — so no standup needed, just hash-tunable `#rx/#ry/#rz`), the full
  9-beat chapter list (intro → form-factor×2 → mounting-plate → drivetrain×2 → re-assemble → electronics top →
  battery+power → finale → settle), dock to a ported case study, `#dbg` group-colour mode. **Verified** via
  headless renders: loads clean (only the expected `appearance.json` 404), classify + Y-up orientation correct,
  translucent-box drivetrain focus reads well. **Render insight:** the "hook with gear" is the **top** hook
  (servo-driven, cog at its base); the **bottom hook** is on its own shaft (the manual-wand control); the
  big hinged flat panel = `BoxTop` = the **mounting plate** (✓); the **XIAO is modeled exploded OUT to the side**
  (user says it should sit inside the box, USB-C poking out — needs relocating).
- **2026-06-10** — **BlindMaster drivetrain + 11-position payoff act built & verified.** The user confirmed the
  kinematics: **1:1 opposite** meshing gears, **1 turn per position step** (10 turns for 0→10), and the **bottom
  hook is an independent manual wand** (NOT servo-driven → stays put when animating app-driven motion). Built
  `buildDrivetrain()`: finds the `drive` (hook-gear) + `encgear` meshes, derives each shaft's world-Y axis as the
  XZ centroid of the gear **disk** (drive uses only its lower 45% so the hook doesn't skew the axis; encoder gear
  uses all verts), snapshots `base`/`parentInv` world matrices + `matrixAutoUpdate=false`. `spinGear(g,angle)`
  rotates about world +Y through the pivot (`local = parentInv · T(piv)·Ry·T(-piv) · base`). `onResolve` drives
  `curPos = posAt(s)` over the drivetrain range `[0.32,0.62]` (keyframes
  `5→0→10→0→10→5` = a couple of back-and-forths ending open), `driveAngle = pos·2π`, encoder gear `−angle`.
  **Key trick:** every integer position = whole turns → the hook sits at base orientation, so resetting the gears
  for the next (assembled) beat shows **no snap**. `drawDims('drive')` renders the readout (lower-left): a
  **venetian-slat glyph** whose slat projected height = openness (thin/gapped at pos 5 = OPEN with a sky-gradient
  showing through, solid when closed at 0/10), a big `N / 10` + `POSITION · OPEN/CLOSING ↑↓`, and
  `ENCODER · {pos·24} ticks · {pos} turns` (EC12 = 24 detents/turn). The two drivetrain chapters carry
  `act:'drive'` + `dims:'drive'` (the dims overlay holds across both). **Verified** headless at multiple scroll
  points: gears rotate in tandem, wand static, slats track 0↔10, labels correct, seamless reset (only the expected
  `appearance.json` 404). *(Note: shotu.cjs's scrollFrac runs a few % ahead of storyboard `p` because the page
  also includes the case-study article after the spacer — read the live `#hud-progress`, don't trust the frac.)*
  **Still to build:** `drawDims('size')` dimension call-outs, the mounting-plate hinge animation, the full-stack
  finale actors (app↔server↔hub + BLE arc), XIAO relocation, and an appearance/colour pass.
- **2026-06-10** — **Appearance JSON compaction (854 KB → 1.4 KB).** The user flagged `rescuevision/appearance.json`
  as suspiciously huge (**854 227 bytes / 58 551 lines**) and asked if it was a perf risk. Diagnosed: no
  *runtime* cost (the JSON is gone after load → materials/groups), but real download+parse waste + noisy git diffs,
  and it encoded **contradictory/dead data**. Three multiplicative bloat sources, all in `mesh_2_3#5`: (1) the
  editor only ever *appends* face entries and never compacts, so the same 9 914-tri body was painted **5×** across
  sessions (3× app 5, 2× app 2) — `paintFacesMulti` is last-wins per triangle (`slotOf[t]=slot`), so 4 copies were
  dead; (2) no run-length encoding (a connected body is mostly *consecutive* indices — 9 914 → 59 runs); (3)
  pretty-print (`JSON.stringify(…,null,2)`) put every index on its own line (→ the 58 k lines). **Fix in
  `viewers/shared/appearance.js`:** added `expandTris` (reads BOTH legacy flat `[i,…]` and new RLE `[[s,e],…]`),
  `encodeRuns`, and exported **`compactAppearance(json, triCountOf)`** — flatten last-wins per mesh → drop face
  tris equal to the base `part` (fall-through) → promote whole-mesh single-app to `parts` → merge by app +
  RLE-encode. `groupFaces` now `expandTris`-es on read (both `applyAppearance` *and* the editor); the editor
  constructor normalizes loaded faces to flat; `exportJSON` routes through `compactAppearance` and stops
  pretty-printing. **Migrated the live file in place** via the *real* shipping `compactAppearance` (imported
  in-browser through the headless harness → zero logic drift): 854 KB → **1 423 bytes / 1 line** (~600×). Result
  is just `mesh_2_3#5` app 5 = 8 760 tris in **18 ranges** + 2 tiny entries (the 9 914 app-2 tris dropped as
  identical-to-base-part). **Verified:** loads with no console errors; pixel-diffed BEFORE/AFTER at 5 storyboard
  beats and **the user confirmed it renders identically**. Decided AGAINST a "store one seed tri + re-flood at
  load" scheme — most compact but depends on stable vertex ordering across GLB re-exports, which has already bitten
  this project (SmartPT's `mesh_1*`/`mesh_2*` renumber). Original backed up at
  `/private/tmp/appearance.rescuevision.orig.json`. (SmartPT's `appearance.json` was already tiny — 1.4 KB,
  parts/faces empty — so nothing to migrate there; new exports compact automatically.)
- **2026-06-10** — **Portrait fit scale (`PORTRAIT_FIT`).** The pan fix centred the model but a *wide* model
  (e.g. the guadaloop yoke) still clipped off the sides on portrait, because base framing only fits the
  largest dimension in the **vertical** FOV — the narrower **horizontal** FOV on portrait isn't accounted
  for. Added `PORTRAIT_FIT` (engine.js, near `PAN_FULL_ASPECT`): `frameCamera` now multiplies `dist` by
  `fitScale = 1 + max(0, tan(vHalf)/tan(hHalf) − 1) · PORTRAIT_FIT`, where `hHalf = atan(tan(vHalf)·aspect)`.
  So it **zooms the camera out only on narrow/portrait viewports** to also fit the width (0 = off/old, 1 =
  fully fit width; landscape/desktop compute `fitScale=1`, untouched). **Default 0.8.** Live-tunable by eye
  with a `#pfit=` URL hash (parsed once at module load). Verified guadaloop yoke beat: pfit 0 clips the left
  leg + W call-out; **0.8 fits the whole model** with both H/W call-outs; landscape (844×390) pixel-identical.
- **2026-06-10** — **Cache-control / forced-reload fix (deploy).** Recorded that the site is hosted on
  **Cloudflare Pages** at **aditya.pulipaka.com** (repo `pulipakaa24/personal_site`, branch `main`; a push
  auto-deploys). Diagnosed why CSS/JS edits weren't showing up (the user hit it in Safari): live headers
  (`curl -sI`) showed HTML + `.glb` served `cache-control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate` (always
  revalidate → fresh each load) but **`.css`/`.js` served `max-age=14400, must-revalidate`** — Cloudflare's
  default 4-hour **Browser Cache TTL** pinned the stylesheets/scripts with no revalidation, so edits to
  `project.css`/`project.js`/`viewer.css`/`engine.js`/`appearance.js` could lag up to 4h in any browser (NOT
  a device-side issue). **Fix:** added a Pages **`_headers`** file (repo root) forcing `*.css`/`*.js` (and
  explicitly `*.html`) to `public, max-age=0, must-revalidate` so they revalidate every load (ETag → cheap
  304 when unchanged) like the HTML already does. Takes effect on the next push (Pages reads `_headers` from
  the build-output root = repo root). **Verify post-deploy:** `curl -sI https://aditya.pulipaka.com/assets/project.css`
  should now report `max-age=0`. If it still shows `max-age=14400`, the **zone-level** Browser Cache TTL is
  overriding response headers → in the Cloudflare dashboard set *Caching → Configuration → Browser Cache TTL
  → "Respect Existing Headers"* (the `_headers` value then wins). (Considered a `?v=<hash>` pre-commit
  cache-bust hook as a bulletproof, CDN-independent alternative — deferred; `_headers` chosen for zero
  per-push churn. If we ever add it, note `appearance.js` imports `./engine.js`, so the nested import must be
  stamped consistently with the HTML-level `engine.js?v=` ref or engine.js loads twice as two module URLs.)
- **2026-06-10** — **Landing-page mobile fixes** (`index.html`). (1) **Coursework** was a 2-col grid of groups
  that stayed 2-col on phones (it was missing from the `@media(max-width:860px)` `grid-template-columns:1fr`
  list — `.skillgroups` was there, `.coursegroups` wasn't) → added `.coursegroups` so the groups stack into
  one column. (2) **"Currently…" status pill** squished on phones → restructured the markup into two `.role`
  spans + a `.sep`; new `@media(max-width:600px)` stacks them (`.status-roles{flex-direction:column}`,
  `.sep{display:none}`, dot aligned to line 1) so it reads on two lines (Qualcomm / Guadaloop). Desktop
  unchanged (single line). Verified at 390px (pill 57px/two lines, coursework 1 col) and 1280px (pill 36px/one line).
- **2026-06-10** — **Viewer chrome: glass nav chips + collapsible/replayable docked model window.**
  (1) **Nav glass chips** (all 3 viewers, `viewer.css`): the brand (logo+name) and the "Back to work" button now
  float as their own **blurred translucent pills** (`backdrop-filter: blur(14px) saturate(1.3)` + faint tint +
  `-webkit-` prefix for Safari + subtle border/shadow so they read over the pure-black hero). nav was already
  `z-index:8`, so they were always on top — this just gives them a backdrop. (2) **Docked-window controls**
  (RescueVision + SmartPT, in the shared **`DockController`**): a transparent click-catcher `#dockwin` over the
  card whose **click replays the walkthrough** — `replay()` smooth-scrolls back up to `_storyEnd −
  innerHeight*0.5` (the last storyboard beat, full-screen), reusing the existing dock lerp to grow the model
  back; a **minimise** button `#dockmin` ("›") that **collapses the card off the right edge**
  (`#c.docked.collapsed { transform: translateX(calc(100%+30px)) }`) leaving a thin **edge tab** `#docktab`
  ("‹ 3D") that restores it; and **auto-restore** when the user scrolls back up toward the 3D (`update()`
  clears `collapsed` once `dockK < DOCK_FULL`). The two click behaviours are deliberately separated (minimise =
  the small corner button; body-click = replay) so they never misfire. Controls are built in JS by
  `DockController._buildDockUI()` (no per-viewer HTML), shown only when essentially fully docked (`k≥0.985`),
  with `touch-action:pan-y` on `#dockwin` so vertical swipes still scroll on mobile, real `<button>`s +
  aria-labels, and bigger tap targets under `@media(pointer:coarse)`. Updated the stale `#dockhint` text
  ("Drag the model…" → "Click to replay the 3D · minimise ›"). Guadaloop is unaffected (no dock; gets the nav
  chips only). Verified: functional flow (open→minimise→edge-tab→restore→replay scrolled 11325→9297) + no
  console errors on RescueVision & SmartPT; nav chips render in desktop Chrome **and** real iOS-Simulator Safari.
- **2026-06-10** — **Mobile pass: fixed the iOS "stuck on frame 1" scroll bug + perf + layout.**
  **Root cause (all three viewers):** the full-screen `position:fixed` `#c` canvas was `pointer-events:auto`
  during the storyboard (CSS default for guadaloop; `DockController.applyDock` forces `auto` while `k≈0` for
  rescuevision/smartpt). On iOS WebKit a finger-press lands on that viewport-filling **interactive** fixed
  canvas, which isn't itself scrollable, so the document never scrolls → `scrollY` stays 0 → storyboard
  frozen on frame 1. Desktop was unaffected (wheel-scroll ignores `pointer-events`), which hid the bug.
  **Fix:** `#c` is now `pointer-events:none` by default (`viewer.css`), with `body.editing #c{pointer-events:auto}`
  for the editors (OrbitControls / part-picking); `applyDock` sets `(COARSE || k>0.5) ? 'none':'auto'` so
  desktop keeps the RescueVision finale phone-drag while **touch devices always let the page scroll through
  the canvas**. **Perf:** new exported const `COARSE = matchMedia('(pointer:coarse)').matches` in `engine.js`;
  on coarse devices the renderer drops MSAA (`antialias:!COARSE`), caps DPR at 1.5 (vs 2), and asks
  `powerPreference:'high-performance'`. **Layout:** added a `@media (max-width:640px)` block to `viewer.css`
  — the right-rail `#panel`/`#blurb` span full width (still right-aligned) instead of a crushed ~150px column,
  the long nav `.lbl` is hidden, `#dockhint` no longer overflows. **Verified three ways (see §6):** a
  real-WebKit hit-test A/B (Playwright webkit) proving the center-press hits `#c` OLD vs `body`/`#spacer`
  FIXED on all three; the iPhone-viewport puppeteer harness (storyboard drives, no console errors, mobile
  layout); and an authentic iOS-Simulator Safari screenshot of the fixed build.
- **2026-06-10** — **Mobile pan fix (portrait off-the-left-edge).** Follow-up to the mobile pass: the
  storyboard `pan` shifts the subject by a fixed **world** amount (`frameCamera` `shift = r*pan*1.5`), so its
  on-screen effect scales as ~1/aspect — a narrow **portrait** phone (aspect ≈0.46) threw the model ~4-5×
  further left (off the edge) while landscape/desktop looked fine. Fixed in the shared `frameCamera` by
  scaling the shift by `Math.min(1, camera.aspect / PAN_FULL_ASPECT)` (`PAN_FULL_ASPECT = 1.6`): only ever
  **reduces** pan on narrow viewports, leaving aspect≥1.6 (desktop + **landscape phones**) pixel-identical,
  and degrading smoothly (no orientation breakpoint / rotate-jump). One line in the engine → all three
  viewers + every chapter. Verified portrait (390×844) vs landscape (844×390): the guadaloop yoke beat that
  was a corner fragment is now centered; landscape unchanged. *(Chose aspect-scaling over a discrete portrait
  toggle so resize/rotation/tablet/split-screen all do the right thing for free.)*
- **2026-06-10** — **Shared the dock shell (DRY refactor).** Extracted the duplicated "viewer shell" out of
  rescuevision + smartpt into `viewers/shared/`: (1) a **`DockController`** class in `engine.js` owning the
  scroll→`progress`/`dockK` mapping, `applyDock`, the overlay fade, the `#case .reveal` observer, and the
  docked rotisserie + smooth two-way hand-off (see §5 + §7); viewers now just `dock = new DockController({…})`
  in `start()` and call `dock.update()` in `tick()`. (2) **`pca(pts)`** (+ private `eigenSym3`) moved to
  `engine.js` — both viewers' inline copies removed (RescueVision's `analyzeGroup` now wraps `pca`; SmartPT
  imports it). (3) Docked-card CSS (`#c.docked`, `#dockhint`) moved to `viewer.css`. Viewers dropped ~95
  lines each (684→587, 726→634); the dock logic now lives once and BlindMaster (#3) inherits it for free.
  Guadaloop is unaffected (it has no dock — never constructs a DockController). Verified: all three viewers
  load with no console errors; both dock correctly (`canvas.docked=true`); docked-window occlusion + framing
  unchanged in headless renders.
- **2026-06-10** — **Docked-card polish (RescueVision + SmartPT).** Two fixes to the top-right
  floating model card after the case study begins. (1) **Opaque floating window:** `#c.docked` now has
  an opaque background (`#0a0b0e`) and `z-index:6` (above `#case`'s `z-index:5`), so the opaque **Status**
  fact cell + the **"how it works"** cards scroll cleanly *behind* it instead of clashing over the model.
  (Previously the canvas was `z-index:1` *behind* the article with a `rgba(8,9,12,.6)` translucent bg —
  page content painted over/through it.) (2) **Smooth two-way rotation hand-off** in the `tick()` loop:
  the docked rotisserie is now an azimuth `ang = ang0 + wrapPi(dockSpin)*spinKeep` orbiting `boxes.all`,
  where `ang0` is the iso azimuth the storyboard settles on, `dockSpin` accumulates only when **fully
  docked** (`dockK ≥ DOCK_FULL 0.999`, eased up from rest), and `spinKeep = smoothstep((dockK −
  DOCK_SETTLE 0.8)/(DOCK_FULL − DOCK_SETTLE))`. The orbit branch now owns the whole band `dockK ∈
  [0.8, 1]` (below 0.8 → `story.resolve` + reset `dockSpin`). Result: docking *in* the spin eases up from
  the settled iso pose (no jolt), and scrolling back *up* the model rotates from wherever the carousel is
  back to iso along the **shortest path** (`wrapPi`, so minutes of accumulated spin don't whirl backwards)
  purely as a function of scroll position in the band. Verified headless (opaque occlusion + return sweep);
  no console errors.
- **2026-06-10** — SmartPT **thigh-rod aiming fix**. The thigh rod was built ALONG the bore (`legAxis`),
  whose direction swings wildly with the flex angle (up-left at 124°, up-through-blue at 160°) → looked
  like it pointed the wrong way / overshot the knee. Now `aimThigh(signed)` re-orients it every frame to
  point from the knee toward the **rotated upper-shell centroid** (`actors.upperCenter` rotated about the
  hinge), so it consistently threads up through the blue (thigh) shell at every angle; shin still fixed
  through the lower ring. `THIGH_SHIFT` (const `THIGH_SHIFT_FRAC`, ×S, or `#thighshift=`) slides the rod
  along that direction (+ = toward the hip). The arc sweeps from the straight-leg dir to the live thigh dir.
- **2026-06-10** — SmartPT **storyboard revamp + true hinge axis**. (1) Replaced the slide-apart "explode"
  with the **thigh (upper) shell swinging open ~160° about the hinge** ("Two Halves"), holding there;
  "Tracking the Angle" then holds the reveal pose, brings in the leg silhouettes, and does a small
  back-and-forth — all moving the UPPER shell (was the lower). Constants `BIG_ANGLE` (160°), `TRACK_AMP`,
  `ROT_SIGN` (default −1 = swing back-and-up; `#rotsign`/`#bigangle`/`#trackamp` tune them). New `settle`
  act ramps back to assembled for the dock; framing uses a computed `boxes.swung` box so the swung pose
  isn't clipped. (2) **True hinge axis** — the device has TWO pin-hole knuckles (one per arm); the old PCA
  of the whole contact was dominated by the broad concentric band-seam and tilted the axis off the real
  pin (tab/slot separated mid-swing, thigh rod missed the ring). `detectHinge()` now keeps the upper-arm
  contact, splits it into the two knuckles, and uses the **line through their centres** as the pin axis.
  `#hingedbg` overlays contact pts (red) / pivot (yellow) / axis (cyan) to verify. (3) **Leg silhouette
  rebuilt** along the real bore axis (`legAxis = tubeAxis`): shin fixed to the lower shell (threads the
  lower ring), thigh rigid with the upper shell via a hinge-pivoted group (threads the upper ring).
  Docked branch snaps to the clean assembled pose.
- **2026-06-10** — SmartPT **IMU fixes** (user re-exported the GLB → IMU groups renamed `mesh_1*`/`mesh_2*`):
  (1) `classify()` keys off the MPU **group** name (`mpu6050step1`→imu2, else `mpu6050step`→imu1) — survives
  mesh renumbering; the old `/mesh0/`,`/mesh3/` regex matched nothing so both IMUs became `'other'` and
  didn't move. (2) **Auto-bind** each IMU to the shell it's seated against (nearest surface), in
  `buildActors` — the static imu1→upper/imu2→lower guess was backwards on the new export. (3) Fixed a
  **matrix-aliasing bug**: `moverApply` reused the shared `_mm` that also held the caller's hinge matrix →
  IMUs flew off mid-flex; it now uses its own `_ap` scratch. (4) **Flip the upper shell + its IMU 180° about
  the bore/tube axis** — defined as the shell's **local +Y in world** (`shellNode.getWorldQuaternion()`
  applied to (0,1,0)), NOT a PCA ring-normal (using PCA was the "wrong axis" the user flagged twice). Done
  in `buildActors` before the movers capture base; the hinge is computed from the **pre-flip** seam so the
  flex still reads (recomputing post-flip looked broken). Tunable `#upperflip=deg`; `#dbg` colour-codes the
  vis groups. *(Replaced an earlier experimental `flipInner()` that rotated the whole upper shell + the
  wrong IMU about a PCA axis.)*
- **2026-06-09** — SmartPT **orientation**: redefined `standUpright()` so the **hinge is up** (hinge-seam
  pin axis → horizontal X so the knee flex bends in the vertical screen plane; cuff→hinge → +Y; IMU side
  faced to camera). Earlier attempt stood the *tube* axis up, leaving the hinge pointing backward (user
  flagged it). Added a **live orientation tuner**: open `viewers/smartpt/index.html#tune` → drag to
  rotate the model, `[`/`]` to roll, HUD prints a copy-pasteable `#rot=rx,ry,rz` (Euler XYZ degrees).
  `#rot=...` on the URL overrides the orientation entirely (what the tuner emits == what gets baked).
- **2026-06-09** — **Built the SmartPT viewer** (`viewers/smartpt/index.html`). The user updated the GLB
  to 14 meshes (added the 2nd IMU). Storyboard: hero → overview → **explode** (two shells slide apart,
  each IMU stays attached) → **track** (hinge flexes, live "NN° · KNEE FLEXION · IMU Δ" readout + 3D angle
  arc + translucent leg silhouette through the cuff) → settle → dock to the case study (shared
  `project.css`). Hinge axis/pivot computed live from the contact seam; part motion via world-space
  `parentInverse` movers. Wired the landing-page SmartPT card/honor/PROJECTS map to the viewer (3D badge).
  Deleted all inspector scaffolding. See §17 (incl. open polish: flex foreshortening from iso). Verified
  with headless renders of every beat — no console errors.
- **2026-06-09** — RescueVision **docked case study now uses the shared `assets/project.css`** identity
  (was a bespoke inline approximation). Restructured the `<article id="case">` markup to the standard
  `.wrap/.award/.lede/.facts/.block/.dives/.dive/.btn/footer` structure (copy preserved verbatim),
  added a reveal `IntersectionObserver`, and tuned the intro to clear the top-right docked model card.
  Verified head + mid renders match the project-page look. See §7 Dock-to-case-study.
- **2026-06-09** — Started **SmartPT viewer** scaffolding (`viewers/smartpt/`, paused pending the user
  updating the model). Copied `PTDeviceAssem.glb` + a clean palette-only `appearance.json`; analyzed the
  GLB (see §17). Decided with the user: **two IMUs** (clone the single modeled MPU-6050 into the empty
  twin pocket on the other clamshell) + a **bending leg silhouette** with an angle arc. Inspector pages
  `_inspect/_slots/_pockets/_imutest.html` are throwaway scaffolding (note: the user is replacing the
  model, so any measured constants below will need re-measuring).
- **2026-06-09** — Created this master context doc (`CLAUDE.md`).
- **2026-06-09** — RescueVision frame act, stage 2: changed second view to rotate **down** (camera below,
  looking up) and zoom in tighter. `VIEWS.iso2` set to `(0.34,-0.18,0.90)`; stage-2 chapter `fit`
  1.55 → **1.25**. Verified via headless render.
- **2026-06-08/09** — RescueVision **coordinate frames** reworked: small thin on-top gizmos derived from
  runtime PCA per `dwm_geom.h`; precise per-user axis directions (IWR X=long body / Y=boresight out the
  bump / Z=down; UWB X=flat normal / Y=thin side / Z=down); real transform values 43.18/13.97/92.43,
  dist 103.0. CS1 centered on the radar antenna bump; **CS2 auto-centered on the DWM antenna sub-body**
  (`mesh_67_2`). Added a **two-stage** frame act (iso establish → iso2 down/zoom focus) with grid/gizmos/
  legs driven off global progress so they persist across the boundary; dims overlay made neighbor-aware
  (no flicker).
- **2026-06-08/09** — RescueVision **per-sub-body coloring**: AppearanceEditor gained **Body** mode
  (vertex-adjacency flood, no angle limit) so e.g. ESP32 RF shield / sensor antenna square can be colored
  independently. Fixed multi-face/body bug via `paintFacesMulti` (single batched geometry-group rebuild).
- **2026-06-08/09** — RescueVision **orientation** fixed via PCA, driven off the **ESP32** axes (upright +
  face-to-camera), correcting an earlier wrong `ry=-45` cavity-facing attempt. Standup `rx=-90` then
  ESP_U→+Y / ESP_N→iso-azimuth. Hash-tunable `#rx/#ry/#rz`.
- **2026-06-08** — **RescueVision viewer built** (`viewers/rescuevision/`): hub.glb load, loose-part
  hiding (110/124), `classify()` vis-groups, full storyboard (intro → IWR → stepper → ESP32 → frame →
  localization finale → settle), draggable-phone finale, **dock-to-case-study** scroll. Wired into the
  landing page (featured card + honor + PROJECTS map, 3D badge).
- **2026-06-08** — **Shared viewer framework extracted** (`viewers/shared/{engine.js,appearance.js,
  viewer.css}`) from the Guadaloop prototype; **AppearanceEditor** (Part/Body/Face, palette, export JSON)
  built; Guadaloop viewer **ported** onto the engine; file structure reorganized under `viewers/`.
- **earlier** — Site moved into `personal_site/` (own git repo). Landing page, 6 project case-study pages,
  Guadaloop scroll prototype with the CAD-render lighting recipe, resume update.

## 13. Requests log (what the user has asked for)

✅ done · 🔄 in progress · ⬜ not started.

- ✅ Build Guadaloop-style scroll 3D viewers for the hardware projects, **starting with RescueVision**;
  first extract reusable styles/framework into a shared file and reorganize the file structure.
- ✅ RescueVision start page like Guadaloop but with the rescuevision GLB; **appearance/color picker
  scaffolding** to choose appearances per part / sub-body / face and export JSON.
- ✅ RescueVision storyboard: isolate IWR sensor → stepper → ESP32 (two segments) → gridlines + coordinate
  frames showing the sensor↔UWB transform → zoom-out localization finale with phone/person, UWB waves
  from the Qorvo module, dotted→solid ranging line, draggable phone.
- ✅ After the visualization, return to a normal scrolling case-study (model shrinks to top-right, user
  keeps scrolling).
- ✅ Fix: multi-face appearances per part; counter-clockwise tilt; backside view → face the viewer.
- ✅ Per-**sub-body** coloring (Body mode); accurately aligned coordinate frames per `dwm_geom`, with the
  exact axis directions he specified.
- ✅ Rotate to a **second perspective** while the coordinate bases are shown (extra slightly-rotated stage).
- ✅ Center CS2 on the little DWM antenna body; make the second view more intentional — **rotate down +
  zoom in**.
- ✅ This doc: a master context/style/instructions document, continuously updated.
- ✅ Make the RescueVision **docked case study match the standard project-page (TweinStein) look**, with
  the model staying docked top-right. *(Done 2026-06-09 — now uses `assets/project.css`.)*
- ✅ **SmartPT viewer** (`PTDeviceAssem.glb`): explode the brace pieces (IMUs stay attached), then a
  hinge-flexion stage with the two IMUs tracking the knee angle + a bending leg silhouette, then dock to
  the case study. *(Done 2026-06-09 — see §17. Open polish items there await the user's steer on the
  device's natural pose / flex viewing angle.)*
- ✅ **Make the site perform well on mobile** + fix the iOS Safari bug where the viewers were "stuck on the
  first storyboard frame" (couldn't scroll), and set up an iPhone test loop. *(Done 2026-06-10 — root cause
  was the interactive full-screen fixed canvas eating the touch-scroll gesture on iOS WebKit; fixed with
  canvas `pointer-events:none` on touch devices, plus a coarse-pointer render budget and a
  `@media(max-width:640px)` viewer layout. iPhone/iOS-sim/real-WebKit verification loops documented in §6.)*
- ✅ **Invert the viewer flow on all four viewers: case study FIRST (styled like the other case-study pages,
  with the 3D model as a top-right floater), then scrolling to the bottom enlarges the floater (rotation ramps
  from the carousel pose to iso), the title fades in once full-screen, then the 3D walkthrough.** Plus: the
  bottom button now says **"Back to case study"** (→ top of page) instead of "Skip to case study"; clicking the
  floater jumps to the visualizer start; and a soft-pulsing **"Explore in 3D ↓"** hint chip under the floater
  (since the walkthrough isn't shown up front). *(Done 2026-06-11 — an inversion of the existing dock machinery;
  see §12 + §5. Verified headless desktop + mobile, all four. Open: Guadaloop's "rig above" lede copy, §15.)*
- 🔄 **Confirm the coordinate-axis out-sign combo** (`#cs1y/#cs1z/#cs2x/#cs2z`) so it can be baked as
  default and the hash dropped. *(Awaiting the user's eyes on the clearer second view.)*
- 🔄 Build the **BlindMaster** viewer (`servobox.glb`). *(Design locked + foundation built & verified
  2026-06-10 — see §18. Storyboard agreed with the user; remaining: scroll-tied drivetrain animation,
  tilting-slat position overlay, dimension call-outs, mounting-plate hinge, full-stack finale, XIAO
  relocation, appearance pass. Awaiting user's gear kinematics / motion study for the drivetrain beat.)*

---

## 14. Roadmap / what remains

1. **Bake the coordinate-axis out-signs** once the user confirms the combination (then remove the
   `#cs1y/#cs1z/#cs2x/#cs2z` hash handling). — *highest priority, just needs his confirmation.*
2. **BlindMaster viewer** (`servobox.glb`) — *foundation built (§18); storyboard locked.* Remaining:
   the scroll-tied drivetrain animation (servo hook-gear ↔ encoder gear in tandem + bottom hook),
   the tilting-slat 0–10 position overlay, dimension call-outs, the mounting-plate hinge mini-beat,
   the full-stack finale (app↔server↔hub + BLE arc), relocating the exploded XIAO into the box, and an
   appearance pass. Landing card already exists (weak thumbnail — candidate to swap for a device render).
3. **SmartPT viewer polish** (§17 open items) — if the user wants: a base model rotation / dedicated
   camera so the knee flex reads in the screen plane; a more leg-like silhouette; dress the model colours
   via the **G** editor + commit `appearance.json`.
4. **Landing-page placeholders to fill:** LinkedIn + GitHub URLs (footer + project pages currently use
   `#` with a click-note), SmartPT TestFlight link, confirm which PDF is the real résumé, hero visuals
   for the abstract-placeholder project pages.
5. Possible CS2 antenna-centering refinement toward the bottom-**right** corner if the user wants it
   tighter than bottom-center.
6. **Mobile polish (optional, after on-device pass):** ✅ the portrait off-the-left-edge `pan` is fixed
   (aspect-scaled in `frameCamera`, `PAN_FULL_ASPECT`). Remaining nice-to-haves: consider `100dvh` for
   `#c`/`#spacer` so the iOS address-bar resize doesn't jump the canvas; if the RescueVision finale
   phone-drag is wanted on mobile, give the canvas `touch-action:pan-y` + re-enable pointer-events only in
   the finale (so vertical scroll still works). The scroll/perf/layout fix itself is **verified in real
   WebKit + iOS Simulator**, but the literal finger-swipe still wants a quick **on-device confirm** (synthetic
   touch isn't scriptable here).

---

## 15. Open questions / pending decisions

- **RescueVision coordinate-axis out-signs** — which of `#cs1y / #cs1z / #cs2x / #cs2z` should be
  flipped? Defaults are best-guess; the firmware fixes the *magnitudes* (43.18/13.97/92.43, −10° tilt)
  but the visual arrow directions need the user's confirmation. Bake once confirmed.
- ✅ **Guadaloop lede copy** — after the 2026-06-11 flow inversion the old lede said "The rig **above** is the hard
  part to control" which no longer matched the layout (rig is the floater / walkthrough is below). **Resolved** — the
  user reworded it to lead with "**LevSim** is the simulation environment I built…" (no positional reference).
- **Floater size on mobile** — the docked card is near-full-width on phones (clamped to `innerWidth−40`). The
  inverted flow now handles it with `body article#case{padding-top:408px}` (hero-card → article), but a smaller
  mobile card is a possible future tweak if the full-width hero feels too dominant.
- **BlindMaster thumbnail** — currently the inverted Flutter blinds icon (weak); maybe swap for an app
  screenshot or a `servobox` render.
- Confirm which PDF in `assets/` is the real résumé.

## 16. How to keep this doc updated (re-read §0 at top)

This is the closing ritual of every task:
1. Did architecture/behavior change? → update §4–§9.
2. Did you learn a new gotcha or recipe? → update §10 (and the lighting/PCA notes).
3. Did you ship something? → prepend a **Changelog** (§12) entry with the date.
4. Did the user ask for something new, or did an item finish? → update **Requests Log** (§13),
   **Roadmap** (§14), **Open Questions** (§15).
5. Bump the "Last updated" date at the top.

Keep it accurate and concrete (real file paths, real constants, real line anchors). The next agent —
possibly with no other context — relies on this being true.

## 17. SmartPT viewer (`viewers/smartpt/`) — BUILT 2026-06-09

**Device:** a polycentric **knee-brace hinge** (worn around the knee; confirmed by the product
screenshot). `PTDeviceAssem.glb` — **14 meshes** after the user's 2026-06-09 update (the user added the
second IMU themselves): two clamshell bodies `UpperLeg-1` + `LowerLeg-2`, and **two** MPU-6050 IMUs —
`MPU_6050step/pcbstep-1/mesh_0…mesh_0_5` and `MPU_6050step_1/pcbstep-1_1/mesh_3…mesh_3_5`.

**vis-groups (`classify()`, compacted name chain):** `imu1` (`mesh0*`), `imu2` (`mesh3*`), `upper`
(`upperleg`), `lower` (`lowerleg`). **IMU→body binding (measured by nearest-surface distance):** IMU1 →
**UpperLeg** (thigh shell), IMU2 → **LowerLeg** (shin shell). Each IMU stays rigidly with its shell.

**Hinge (computed live, robust to model changes):** in `buildActors`, sample the two shells' world verts,
find the contact seam (lower verts within `S*0.02` of an upper vert), centroid = **pivot**, longest PCA
axis of the seam = **hinge axis** (≈ world +Y on the current model, pivot ≈ the contact centroid). Flexion
= rotate `LowerLeg` + IMU2 about (pivot, axis). **Tube/leg axis** = the smallest PCA-spread axis of a
shell (ring normal); **straightDir** = tubeAxis projected ⟂ to the hinge axis.

**World-space part motion (the key technique):** the IMU meshes are nested under transformed parents, so
naïvely applying a matrix to a mesh's *local* transform warps them. `collectMovers()` snapshots each
mover's world matrix `base` + `parentInverse` once; `moverApply(list, M)` sets each `local =
parentInv · M · base` (decomposed). `setMovers('upperRot'|'rest', amt)` resets from `base` every frame so
acts don't accumulate. **`moverApply` uses its OWN scratch matrix `_ap`** (not the shared `_mm`/`_tt` that
the caller may pass in as `M` — aliasing them flung IMUs off mid-rotation). (Same idea as the Guadaloop
rails-finale movers.)

**Hinge axis (critical):** the device is a real hinge with **TWO pin-hole knuckles** (one per arm). The
PCA of the whole upper↔lower contact is dominated by the broad concentric **band seam** and tilts the axis
off the true pin → the tab/slot separate during the swing and the thigh rod misses the ring.
`detectHinge()` keeps the upper-arm contact (`y > mid`), splits it into the two knuckles, and uses the
**line through their centroids** as the pin axis (pivot = midpoint). `#hingedbg` overlays contact (red) /
pivot (yellow) / axis (cyan).

**Storyboard (`#spacer` 900vh):** intro `[0,0.07]` hero → device/overview `[0.07,0.26]` → **Two Halves**
`[0.26,0.48]` (`act:'twohalves'`: the **upper/thigh shell + its IMU swing open ~`BIG_ANGLE`(160°)** about
the pin and hold; `ROT_SIGN` −1 = back-and-up) → **Tracking** `[0.48,0.82]` (`act:'track'`: holds the
reveal pose with a small back-and-forth `TRACK_AMP`, shows the translucent **leg silhouette** — shin fixed
to the lower shell threading the lower ring, **thigh rigid with the upper shell** via a hinge-pivoted group
threading the upper ring — plus a 3D **angle arc** and the SVG **"NN° · KNEE FLEXION · IMU Δ"** readout)
→ **settle** `[0.82,1.0]` (`act:'settle'`: ramp the upper back to assembled) → dock to the case study (same
`assets/project.css` identity AND the same **opaque-card + smooth rotation hand-off** dock loop as
RescueVision §7 — its orbit branch additionally calls `setMovers('rest',0)` + hides the leg silhouette).
The moving acts frame on a computed **`boxes.swung`** box so the swung-open pose isn't clipped. Leg rods
lie along **`legAxis = tubeAxis`** (the real bore), NOT the old `straightDir`. Hash tuners:
`#bigangle`/`#trackamp`/`#rotsign`/`#upperflip`/`#dbg`/`#hingedbg`. Landing page SmartPT card / honor /
PROJECTS map point here with the 3D cube badge; appearance editor (press **G**) is wired (palette-only
`appearance.json` so far).

> **Flex retiming gotcha:** the shared `Storyboard` fades the `#dims` overlay in only over localT
> 0.45–0.65 and out after 0.88 (neighbour-aware), and `onResolve` runs BEFORE `updateOverlays`. So a flex
> that *peaks* mid-chapter leaves the angle readout faint. Fixed by **ramping the flex to a HELD value
> across the dims window** (ramp by ~0.40, hold with a small cosine wiggle, release after ~0.86).

**Orientation:** `standUpright()` rotates the model so the **hinge is up** — hinge-seam (pin) axis →
horizontal X (knee flex then bends in the vertical screen plane, not foreshortened), cuff→hinge → +Y,
IMU side faced to the iso camera (flip 180° about Y if it'd face away). The cuff hangs below, the two
uprights rise to the hinge knuckle on top. **User-tunable:** open `…/smartpt/index.html#tune` → drag to
rotate, `[`/`]` to roll, HUD prints `#rot=rx,ry,rz` (Euler XYZ deg). `#rot=…` on the URL overrides the
whole orientation (what the tuner emits == what to bake into a default if the user picks a new pose).
*(History: first tried standing the TUBE axis up — left the hinge pointing backward; user corrected.)*

**Open polish:** (1) the leg silhouette is subtle — could be more leg-like / opaque. (2) The model is one
flat colour until dressed via the **G** editor + committed `appearance.json`. (3) Confirm the final pose
with the user (the tuner is theirs to drive).

Inspector scaffolding used to derive all this (`_tree/_analyze/_hinge/_slots/_pockets/_imutest.html` +
`/private/tmp/dumpglb.cjs, shothinge.cjs, shotsp.cjs, shotcase2.cjs`) was **deleted** after the build;
recreate from this section's description if the model changes again.

---

## 18. BlindMaster viewer (`viewers/blindmaster/`) — FOUNDATION BUILT 2026-06-10 (in progress)

**Device:** a full-stack IoT **smart-blinds hub** — `servobox.glb` (the user's CORRECTED export, originally
`pls2'.glb`, copied to `servobox.glb` as the canonical name), **113 meshes**, ~**90 × 132 × 40 mm** (palm-sized; the
"smaller than a phone" form-factor beat is real — depth is 40 mm now that the XIAO is in place rather than exploded
out the back). Keeps the original descriptive CAD names (`CR Servo`, `hook with gear`, `Encoder gear`, `Encoder
EC12E24204A2`, `BlindsBottomHook`, `BoxTop`/`BoxBottom` separate, `xiaoPCB placeholder`, …). The CAD is **GLB Y-up
already** (mounting hook → **+Y**), so **no standup** — just hash-tunable `#rx/#ry/#rz` (deg, world axes). Firmware
source of truth: `BlindMaster/Blinds_XIAO/` (ESP-IDF). *(GLB history: the 1st export had the XIAO exploded; `plswork.glb`
fixed that but merged everything into 28 anonymous "Part_NN" meshes — abandoned; `pls2'` restored the named, separated
parts. See the changelog.)*

**Classification = `GROUPS[name]` (groups.json override) → `ruleClassify(o)` (name rules) → `'other'`** — the
Guadaloop rule+override pattern. A **grouping editor (press G)** is the override layer (orbit, pick a group via swatch
or number key 0–9, click parts to paint, **E** exports `groups.json`); `groups.json` ships empty since the name rules
do everything. *(The old material AppearanceEditor + `appearance.json` were keyed by the dead pre-correction mesh
names — removed/stale; re-dress materials later if wanted. The GLB ships its own per-part materials.)*

**vis-groups (`ruleClassify`, compacted name chain):** `servo` (`crservo`), `drive` (`hookwithgear` — the **top**
hook+gear the servo turns), `encgear` (`encodergear`), `enc` (`encoderec12e24204a2` — the **two** EC12 rotary
encoders), `bottomhook` (`blindsbottomhook` — its own shaft at the base, the **manual wand**), `xiao`
(`seeed|xiao|esp32c6|esp32s3` — **in place** in the corrected GLB), `battery`
(`lipo|batteryholder|phr2forbattery`), `power` (`stepupplaceholder` boost), `pcb` (`xiaopcbplaceholder` MUST precede
the `/xiao/` rule, plus `toppcb|bottompcbreal`),
`plate` (`boxtop` — the big flat **mounting plate**, hinged), `box` (`boxbottom` — main enclosure body), `other`
(pin headers, JST, eBom free-parts blob, button/port placeholders). Composite framing boxes: `boxes.mech`
(servo+drive+encgear+enc+bottomhook), `boxes.elecTop` (xiao+pcb+servo), `boxes.elecBot` (battery+power).

**The mechanism (from geometry + firmware):** a **continuous-rotation servo** (PWM via LEDC; `ccwSpeed/cwSpeed/offSpeed`
in `defines.h`) turns the **hook-gear**; a meshed **encoder gear** (parallel **Y**-axis spur gears, thin in Y →
rotation axis ≈ Y, offset ~one gear radius in X) drives a rotary encoder. **Two encoders:** `topEnc`
(`ENCODER_PIN_A/B` D3/D6) tracks the motor-driven output for absolute position; `bottomEnc` (`InputEnc_PIN_A/B`
D0/D1) is a **manual wand** — `servoWandListen` follows `baseDiff = bottomEnc − topEnc` so turning the blind by
hand drives the servo to match. Quadrature decoded in `encoder.cpp` ISR; 4 sub-counts = 1 detent tick.

**Position model (`calibration.cpp`) — the payoff:** calibration records `UpTicks` and `DownTicks` (the two travel
extremes; multi-stage Socket.IO handshake, saved to NVS). `convertToTicks(appPos) = appPos*(Up−Down)/10 + Down +
(Up−Down)/20` → appPos **0–10 maps LINEARLY across the full tick range**, each position centred in its bin (+half-step).
`convertToAppPos` inverts + clamps. Per the case study it's a **venetian tilt**: **0 = closed-down, 5 = flat/open,
10 = closed-up**, and the full sweep is **several gear turns** (the user stressed "more than 1/11 of a rotation").
So the **drivetrain beat and the 11-position payoff are ONE act**: gears sweep a couple of turns ↔ slats tilt
closed→open→closed ↔ a live `POSITION 0…5(OPEN)…10` + tick readout.

**Storyboard (`#spacer` 1250vh; locked with the user):** intro → **01** form-factor ×2 (dimension call-outs,
"smaller than a phone") → **02** mounting-plate hinge mini-beat → **03** drivetrain + 11-position payoff (box
translucent; servo+drive+encgear+enc+bottomhook in focus; scroll-tied tandem gear rotation + bottom-hook rotation +
tilting-slat position overlay; sub-beat on motor-encoder vs manual-wand) → re-assemble → **04** electronics
top/servo side → **05** battery side + power story (MAX17048 fuel gauge / DFS / light-sleep / GPIO-gated servo,
small SoC gauge) → **06** full-stack finale **last** (app↔server↔hub relay + orange **BLE provisioning arc** echoing
the case-study SVG; a Socket.IO `set position` command drives the gear) → settle → dock to the shared `project.css`
case study. Hash: `#dbg` (group-colour check), `#rx/#ry/#rz` (orientation).

**Status (2026-06-10):** on the corrected GLB — load/orient/classify (name rules + grouping-editor override), all 9
beats (framing + panels + translucency, plate now **separate** from box so the mounting beat isolates it), dock +
**synced** case study (architecture SVG ported from `projects/blindmaster.html`), and the drivetrain + 11-position
payoff act all built & verified headless (no console errors; `#dbg` groups correct; gears spin, POSITION readout,
bottom hook static, XIAO in place). Landing-page card + PROJECTS map → the viewer (3D badge). **Gear kinematics
(user-confirmed):** 1:1 opposite, **½ turn/step** (`STEP_TURNS`), rotation anchored at pos 5; bottom hook is an
**independent manual wand** (stays put under app-driven motion). Sweep `POS_KEYS = 5→0→10→5` (~1.5 passes). See
`buildDrivetrain`/`spinGear`/`posAt`/`drawDims('drive')`. **Storyboard COMPLETE (2026-06-11):** all beats built —
form-factor dimension call-outs (`drawDims('size')`/`dimSeg`), mounting-plate **linear lift** (`liftPlate`, not a
hinge), full-stack **finale** (`buildFinale`/`updateFinale`/`finalePos`; phone+server+relay-dots+BLE-arc+`SET POSITION`
badge in `#finlabels`), and the **bidirectional finale fade** over `dockK∈[0,0.8]` (must reach 0 by 0.8 — the
DockController stops resolving the storyboard there). Confirmed blind type = **venetian tilt** (per the 0/5/10 model).
**Optional remaining:** re-dress materials (the appearance path was removed; GLB ships its own); on-device mobile pass.
Throwaway inspector `viewers/blindmaster/_inspect.html` (flags `?glb/?only/?hide/?tint/?rainbow/?reassemble`); stale
model files `plswork.glb`, `pls2'.glb`, `appearance.json` can be deleted.
